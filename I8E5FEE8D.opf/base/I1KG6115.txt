THE AUTHORS OF SUMBUMS
by
LOKESH CHANDRA
New Delhi
Besides the Holy Kanjur and Tanjur, the Tibetan language has an 
immense literature extending to about one hundred thousand titles, 
ranging from one or two pages to thousands of pages. Thus the sacred 
Canon forms only 5% of this enormous literature. After the Canon 
comes another very important literary genre, that of sumbums (spelt as 
gsun hbum), which are the collected works of great saints and thinkers 
of Tibet, China, Inner Mongolia, Mongolian People's Republic (i.e., 
Outer Mongolia), Buryat Mongolian Autonomous Republic of USSR., 
the Kalmuks, and others. The sumbums are the collected works of 
Their Holinesses the Dalai Lamas, the Panchen Lamas, the Lcan-skya 
Hutuktus, the Ḥjam-dbyans-bzhad-pas, the Thu-kwans, the Akyas, and 
other incarnations, besides numerous men of erudition and wisdom. 
These collectanea have been held in the highest veneration by the literati 
of the various Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese peoples. The last 
element (hbum) of the compound gsun-hbum denotes one hundred 
thousand (100,000), which is also the abbreviated title for the Satasă- 
hasrikā Prajñāpāramitā traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna, one of the 
greatest figures in Mahayana Buddhism. As pointed out by a Mongolian 
Lama to me, the use of hbum points to the esteem which the sumbums 
enjoy in the Lamaistic church. Moreover, the sumbums are of prime 
importance for evaluating the contributions of the Tibetans and Mon- 
golians to every field of the Five Sciences.¹ Further they constitute 
invaluable original and elucidative texts, unavailable elsewhere, which 
shed light on Buddhism, ritual, philosophy, history, and the secular 
sciences known to the ancient world.
A few sumbums were catalogued for the first time by Prof. Y. Kana- 
kura, Prof. R. Yamada, Mr. Tokan Tada, and Prof. H. Hadano in 
A Catalogue of the Tohoku University Collection of Tibetan Works on 
Buddhism (Sendai, Japan, 1953). It contains the catalogue of only 17 
sumbums. Besides it, there has been no major effort in this direction 
in spite of its tremendous importance for the understanding of the 
1TUn. introd. § 1 pp. 1,2; § 3 pp. 4-6.

THE AUTHORS OF SUMBUMS
manifold aspects of the history of a great part of the people of Asia. In 
the present article an effort has been made to collect together as far as 
possible all the names of the authors of sumbums, available in the Soviet 
Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, as well as the Tohoku 
University and the International Academy of Indian Culture. This 
material has been collected during trips made by my father Prof. Dr. 
Raghu Vira to China in the summer of 1955, to the Soviet Union in 
1955-56, to the Mongolian People's Republic in the winter of 1955, and 
by myself to the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic 
last year in April and May.
The USSR and the MPR possess the biggest collections of Tibetan 
works at Leningrad and Ulanbator (former Urga). The Leningrad 
University Library has a minor collection of over a thousand titles. 
The Oriental Institute of the Academy of Sciences at Leningrad has the 
biggest collection in the USSR. It is subdivided into the following: (1) 
the "Old Collection", (ii) the "New Collection" (which belonged to the 
Institut Buddhiiskoi Kulturi, Институт Буддийской культури), (iii) 
Baradiin Collection, (iv) the Tsibikov Collection, and (v) the Uncatalogued 
Collection. The Old Collection is classified according to the size of the 
xylographs as A and B. Each size has a different numbering. It is listed 
in three registers as follows:
size Asize B
Register
1.1-12961-2040 
2.1297-19692041-2777 
3.1970-23312778-4091
The New Collection consisting of 3374 titles is listed in seven registers 
as follows: (i) 1-474, (ii) 475-862, (iii) 863-1501, (iv) 1502-1906, (v) 
1907-2481, (vi) 2482-3066, (vii) 3067-3374. This list contains the names 
of authors and the titles of works. Sometimes the extent is also indicated. 
For the first few numbers the name of the publishing monastery has also 
been given. This collection consists mainly of sumbums, whether they 
are complete, semi-complete, or only a small part of the whole.
The titles in the Baradiin Collection are listed in a register which starts 
from no. 1460 and goes up to 1620. A general idea of this can be had 
from its account in the Notices of the Asiatic Museum, vol. VII, Nr. 32.
The Tsibikov Collection has no title-list. Its general inventory was 
published in the Notices of the Asiatic Museum, IV (1904). It consists 
almost entirely of sumbums.
The Unlisted Collection contains about twenty thousand titles accord-

112LOKESH CHANDRA
ing to the estimate of Mr. Boris J. Pankratoff. Its inventory is under 
preparation. It will give the title, extent (or number of folios), the 
author, and the name of the publishing monastery. It may be ready in 
manuscript within the next five years. Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira is the only 
foreign scholar who has worked in this collection for four weeks through 
the courtesy of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He prepared a 
list of the authors of sumbums in this collection, besides collecting a lot 
of other material which will be detailed in his forthcoming report of his 
scientific research-trip to the USSR. It is indicated in this article as 
OI.u.
The richest collection of ancient and modern Mongolian, as well as 
Tibetan literatures is on the shelves of the State Library housed in the 
Committee of Sciences, at Ulanbator (MPR). According to the library 
authorities it contains 98,000 Tibetan titles, which are indexed in the 
modern way on cards giving the author, title, number of volumes if 
necessary, and in the case of collected works the volume-indication. 
In April-May 1957, I, my wife Dr. Sharada Rani and my sister Mrs. Dr. 
Sudarshana Singhal had the unique opportunity of making a pilgrimage 
to this great treasure-house of learning, as guests of the Committee of 
Sciences. His Excellency Prime Minister U. Tsedenbal honoured us by 
granting an interview, and laid me under a deep debt of gratitude by 
affording facilities of working at this library,2 and also of visiting a 
number of historic and modern places, whose illustrated account I intend 
to publish in the near future. Mr. Gombochab (Tib. Mgon-po-skyabs) 
is in charge of the Tibetan section. A learned and saintly figure, he show- 
ed us roof-high stacks after stacks containing historical works, magni- 
ficent editions of holy texts (embroidered, written with gold in relief on 
silver plates, written with ink prepared out of nava-ratnas, superbly 
calligraphed in golden ink on thick dark black paper, editions belonging 
to Their Supreme Holinesses the Jebcundampas, etc.), different editions 
of the Holy Kanjur and Tanjur, numerous sumbums, astronomical,
2 Here I have also to thank Mr. Shinje, the vice-president of the Committee of Sciences, 
the eminent scholar Prof. Dr. Rinchen and his wife Mrs. Ratna Rinchen, Prof. Damdin 
Suren, Prof. Lobsang Vandan, Mr. Bira, Mr. Myagmarjab (Mig-dmar-skyabs = Skt. 
Mangalaśarana) of the Ministry of Culture, Abbot Khampo Erdenipil (Mkhan-po 
Erdeniḥphel =Skt. Ratnavardhana), Venerable Lama Gombodo (Mgon-po-rdo-rje 
=Skt. Näthavajra), Venerable Yishithabkhai (Ye-ses-thabs-mkhas = Skt. Jñāno- 
payapatu), Ven. Dambadarje (Bstan-pa-dar-rgyas), and other lamas of the Gandang 
Monastery, Mr. Horlo our scholar-companion deputed by the Committee of Sciences, 
Mr. Perle the archaeologist, Mr. Chouloun Bat our interpreter, and numerous other 
friends in Mongolia whose affection and helpfulness made our stay comfortable and 
useful.

113THE AUTHORS OF SUMBUMS
philosophical, ritual, and a host of other texts of different genres. Among 
historical texts the Rgya-gar-chos-hbyun of Taranatha, Rgya-nag-chos- 
hbyun, the three different Hor-chos-hbyun of Sumpakhampo, of Dhar- 
matāla (281 folios), and of Rtsa-ba-rta-mgrin, and the Gser-gyi-deb-ther 
were exhibited on the show-table. The Hor-chos-hbyun of Rtsa-ba-rta- 
mgrin is entitled Byan-phyogs hor-gyi yul-du dam-paḥi-chos rin-po-che 
hbyun-tshul-gyi gtam-rgyud bkra-sis chos dun bzhad-paḥi sgra-dbyans. It 
was printed in a monastery in Gobi. The author was a personal friend 
of His Supreme Holiness the Dalai Lama XIII. He was highly venerated 
in Mongolia as well as Tibet as a foremost scholar and as one who knew 
all the original texts of the Holy Canon, on account of which he came 
to be famed as rtsa-ba "one who [knows all] the originals". He passed 
away in 1936. The Gser-gyi-deb-ther is a handwritten work in six parts 
(ka-cha), a compilation from various ancient sources. The State Library 
has seven editions of the Tibetan Kanjur: Narthang, Peking, Urga, 
ms. written with gold, ms. written with silver, magnificient ms. written 
with nava-ratna inks, and a 14th-century ms. of Rgyal-rtse (?Rgyal-rtse 
thes-sbar-ma). There are three editions of the Tanjur, viz. Narthang, 
Derge, and a ms. written with gold. The State Library is unusually rich 
in sumbums, many of which are given in the following list.
In Ulanbator is the Gandang Monastery, with a rich library (Dgah- 
Idan-theg-chen-glin gi dpe-mdzod lha-khan) of unique, rare, and valuable 
Mongolian and Tibetan canonical as well as non-canonical works. The 
Tibetan division of this library is arranged in the ancient classical way 
into: (1) the Holy Canon: Kanjur and Tanjur, (ii) Phar-phyin-gyi skor, 
(iii) Dbu-mahi skor, (iv) Hdul-bahi skor, (v) Mdzod-kyi skor, (vi) Rnam- 
hgrel-gyi skor, (vii) Snags-kyi skor, (viii) Cho-gaḥi skor, (ix) Rtsis-kyi skor, 
and (x) gsun-hbum. Except the first, the other sections contain mostly 
non-canonical literature including the Tibetan writings of eminent 
Mongolian scholars of the past centuries. Each section-name is painted 
and encircled by jvālāmaṇḍalas on the artistically decorated portals of 
the wooden almirahs. In the case of sumbums, the name of each author 
is individually indicated, except of those limited to one or very few
3 A copy of it was presented to me by Ven. Lama Gombodo, Grand Gesgui 
of the Gandang Monastery at Ulanbator.
4 Only two copies of the Urga edition were printed near about 1924, out of which 
one is in the State Library and the other is at the International Academy of Indian 
Culture, presented by His Excellency Prime Minister Tsedenbal to Prof. Dr. Raghu 
Vira during his visit to Ulanbator in December 1955. I am preparing a detailed account 
of this edition and also its catalogue.

volumes. Besides, there is a big dkar-chag of sumbums, a number of 
which are not in this library.
The accompanying list of 125 sumbums gives the name of the author 
of each sumbum followed by the name of the library or libraries where 
it is deposited. The names of authors have been cross-referenced in 
their conventional and abbreviated forms, as well as forms prolonged 
with their degrees, designations and the like. Cross-references have also 
been given under incarnational designations, so that one can find out 
at once, for instance those Panchen Lamas who have written sumbums.

BOROBUDUR: A NEW INTERPRETATION
Lokesh Chandra
Borobudur is the monument par excellence of the Sailendras. The type 
of Sailendra Buddhism has not yet been determined in a definitive manner. 
From a variety of evidence assembled here, we find that it was the Bud- 
dhism of the carya and yoga tantras, which are two of the four divisions 
of tantras.
1. Four divisions of tantras and their distinguishing characteristics
The tantras are classified into four broad divisions: (i) kriya-tan- 
tras, (ii) carya-tantras, (iii) yoga- tantras, and (iv) annutara-yogatan-
tras.
1.1 Each division is presided over by a distinctly differentiated Bud- 
dha. They are as follows:
kriya-tantrasAmitayus
carya-tantrasVairocanäbhisambodhi (one face, dhyana mudra) 
yoga-tantrasSarvavid Vairocana (four faces, cakra in hand) 
anuttara yogi tantrasGuhysamaja Akṣobhya
anuttara yogini tantrasCakrasamvara
1.2 Every division has its fundamental and explanatory tantras. As the 
Borobudur pertains to the yoga-tantras, so we will detail them only. The 
teaching of the yoga division of tantras is set forth in "two works, the 
fundamental tantra Tattvasañgraha (Toh. 479), and the explanatory tantra 
Vajrasekhara (Toh. 480). They have primary commentaries by three men who 
are famed in India as being learned in yoga, namely, Sakyamitra, Buddha- 
guhya, and Anandagarbha". 
Buddhaguhya, who wrote the fundamental commen- 
tary Tantrarthāvatāra (Toh. 2501) on the Tattvasañgraha lived in the mid- 
dle of the eighth century as is attested by his letter (Toh. 4194) to the 
Tibetan King Khri-sron-ldeḥu-btsan who reigned from A.D. 755. His date is 
important as it lends weight to the fact that the eighth century was the 
golden age of yoga-tantras, a fact corroborated by other historic events. 
1.3 The third specific characteristic of the yoga-tantras is that its 
Vajradhātu mandala is surrounded by the Thousand Buddhas. A glance over 
the complete set of 132 mandalas of the Rgyed-sde kun-btus comprising all 
the classes of the tantras reveals that only the Vajradhātu mandala has 
the Thousand Buddhas shown in the outer enceinte. The Tibetan Vajradhatu 
mandala, which follows to every detail the Tibetan translation of the 
'Sanskrit original, is the classical mandala, and it has 1037 (1000 + 37) 
2
deities.
1.4 Among the fundamentals of tantric realisation were the Generation
of the Residence3 (ädhärotpatti) and the Invitation to the deities to be
301

Resident (adheya) therein. The adhara was in the form of a four-sided Su-
meru mountain, above it a canopy (vitana), on top of the canopy the kūṭa- 
gara 'eaved palace' and within it seats for the deities. The first five 
stories are the five terraces of the Sumeru mountain. In the worship of 
mandala, the first step is evocation of the Sumeru, which is adharotpatti 
or generation of the residence, for the adheya or the deities who are in- 
voked to take abode therein. A three-storied eaved palace rests in the 
clouds atop Sumeru. This is the kuṭagara of the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, 
and the three-storied campana of the Gyantse Kumbum, which is specially 
notable for its adherence to the injunctions of the Classical tantric 
texts in minute details of architectural form. For instance, the Nispan- 
nayogavali of Abhayakaragupta which is a fundamental text for the con- 
struction of mandalas, makes it clear that mandalas were situated in a 
kuṭagara or pavillion atop the Sumeru mountain, with the main deity in 
the centre and others in their appropriate placements (p. 8, 26, 42 su- 
merupari, sumerumurdhni 'on the summit of Sumeru').
1.5 The fifth important characteristic was that earlier elements were 
integrated into the scheme of yoga-tantras, whether it be literature, a 
painted scroll, or an architectural mandala. For example, the entire path 
of temporal evolution of the manifestation of Buddhism was not disregard- 
ed, but was mirrored in the structural systematisation of the Tibetan Bud- 
dhist Canon and it was reduced to writing by Bu-ston Rin-chen-grub and by 
others who followed him. It is now available to us in the English trans- 
4 
lation of Mkhas-grub-rjes fundamentals of the tantras by Prof. D. Lessing 
and Alexander Wayman, a work whose potential is yet to be realized for the 
history of the development of Buddh s.n. He sets forth the development in- 
to three yanas: the position of the Bravakas the teachings of the pāramitā 
school in four stages, and finally the teachings of the mantra school a- 
gain in four stages. Mkhas-grub-rje's masterly analysis is a sine qua non 
to understand the philosophical moorings and ritualistic context of the 
Borobudur which integrates in stone the same path of ascension: trävaka- 
yana--Karmavibhanga, jätakas and avadanas of Sakyamuni; pāramita-yāna-- 
Avatamsaka (Gandavyuha and Bhadracari); mantra-yana--Vairocana.
5
Kobo daishi, who introduced Tantric Buddhism (Shingon) to Japan in the 
ninth century, follows the same practice in bringing together the philo- 
sophical evolution of different strata of thought leading from the ear- 
liest through the One Vehicle of Avatamsaka to the Vajradhātu Vairocana in 
the Shingon school as Ten Stage of Spiritual Progress (not to be con- 
fused with the dasa-bhümi), which are:
1.
Various paths of blind life driven by instinctive impulses (the 
stage of common people)
2.The Vehicle of human beings striving to have a moral life (the 
stage of Confucianism)
3.The Vehicle of heavenly beings striving to have supernatural
302

power (the stage of Taoism and Brahmanism)
These three (1-3) are the Wordly Vehicles.
4.The Vehicle of the direct pupils of the Buddha (śravaka) striv- 
ing for a higher spiritual life as in Hinayana Schools, Abhi- 
dharmakosa and Satyasiddhi (state of direct disciples)
5.The Vehicle of the self-enlightened ones (pratyeka-buddha) en- 
joying self-enlightenment yet falling into egoism
6-7.The doctrine of Three Vehicles, holding the Three Vechicles as 
real (the stages of the madhyamika and yogacara Schools)
8-9.The doctrine holding the One Vehicle as real (the stages of the 
Avatamsaka and Tendai Schools)
10.The Diamond Vehicle as held by the Shingon School.
1.61 The Vairocana of the yoga-tantras presupposes the concept of Vai- 
5
rocana in the Avatamsaka. Takakusu says that the Avatamsaka is "a sutra 
in which the mystic doctrine of the Buddha Mahavairocana is minutely des- 
cribed". The last chapter of the Avatamsaka is the Gandavyuha which des- 
cribes the pilgrimage of young Suddhana to fiftythree worthies, both re- 
ligious and secular, to "realise the principle of dharmadhatu". Thus the 
integral relationship of the pilgrimage of Suddhana and Vairocana go back 
to an early period, at the latest to the fourth century when the first 
Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka took place. Vairocana is the lord 
of theKusuma-tala-garbha-vyuhalankara-lokadhatu (Rengedai sekai) in the 
Avatamsaka and also in the Brahmajala-sutra (T. 21, Nj. 554) which was 
translated into Chinese by Shiken during A.D. 223-253. The Avatamsaka 
school had two main representations of: (1) the image of Vairocana as the 
Buddha of this school, and (2) the narrative paintings or sculptures of 
the pilgrimage of Suddhana.
1.62 The Avatamsaka is a mahavaipulya-sutrd. In the Tibetan Kanjur the 
full title is Buddhavatamsaka nama mahavaipulya sutra (Toh. 44). So also 
in the Chinese translation, which can be rendered verbatim as mahavaipulya 
Buddhavatamsaka sūtra (Nj. 87=T. 278, Nj. 88-T. 279). The full title of 
the Mahāvairocana-sutra (T. 848= Nj. 530, Toh. 494) itself indicates that 
it is in direct line of development with the Avatamsaka. In spite of its 
being the fundamental text of the carya-tantras, its title does not bear 
the term tantra, but vaipulya-sutrendraraja: Mahavairocana-abhisambodhi- 
vikurvit-adhisthana-vaipulya-sutrendraraja nama dharmaparyaya (Toh. 494): 
while vaipulya makes it a descendant of the Avatamsaka sutrendraraja indi- 
cates a further and higher stage of development.
2. The presence of carya and yoga tantras in Indonesia
The presence of carya and yoga tantras in Indonesia is attested by 
(1) quotations from the texts of the carya and yoga tantras, (2) theico- 
nography of the San hyan Nagabayu and Kalpabuddha, (3) the mandala plan
303

of the Chandi Sewu, (4) the Nañjuk bronzes, and (5) the Nagarakṛtāgama
indicates that the Budur was a yogatantric sanctuary, and finally (6) the 
architectural complex of the Mendut-Pawon-Borobudur itself.
6
2.1 The San Hyan Kamahayanan Mantranaya (SHKM) is a tantric text from 
Indonesia, with 42 Sanskrit verses, each verse followed by an Old Java- 
nese commentary. Following the pioneering studies of Wogihara Unrai and 
Sakai Shiro, Prof. de Jong (1974) has demonstrated beyond doubt that the 
verses of SHKM are derived from the Mahāvairocana-sūtra and the Adhyardha- 
satika Prajñāpāramitā. Verses a-5ab, 6-9, 16-18, 20-22 are from the Maha- 
vairocana-sutra (T. 848, Nj. 530, Toh. 494); while verses 26-42 stem from 
the Adhyardhaśatika (T. 244, Nj. 1037, Toh. 488). The Mahāvairocana-sutra 
belongs to the carya-tantras and the Adhyardhasatikā to the yoga-tantras. 
The SHKM proves the presence of the carya and yoga tantras in Indonesia. 
2.2 There are two more Buddhist texts: Saň hyaň Nāgabāyu-sūtra and 
Kalpabuddha. They have rightly been recognised by Bosch as deriving their 
value by "mentioning the names of the five Dhyani-buddhas and some of their 
principal attributes and characteristics". They supply us with requisite 
data to assign their precise division of tantras and also determine the 
manifestation of this division as a mandala. Out of the four divisions 
of tantras there are two whose central deity is Vairocana, namely the 
carya tantras and yoga tantras. The carya-tantras are represented by the 
texts of Mahāvairocana-ābhisambodhi-vikurvita-adhisthana-vaipulya-su- 
trendra-rāja (Toh. 494 = Sino-Japanese text T. 848, Nj. 530) and the Aca- 
la-kalpa (Toh. 495). The major texts of the yoga-tantras are the Tattva- 
sangraha and its explanatory tantra entitled the Vajrasekhara. Vairocana 
has separate and distinctive forms in these two divisions: in the yoga- 
tantras he is in the bodhyagri mudra while in the carya-tantras he is in 
ihyana mudra. Both these forms are clearly delineated in the Indian, Ne- 
palese, Tibetan and Sino-Japanese traditions. The iconography can be seen, 
for instance, in the Vajradhātu and Garbhadhātu mandalas of the Shingon 
tradition: The Vajradhātu Vairocana is in the bodhyagri mudra while the 
Garbhadhātu Vairocana is in the dhyana mudra. Both the Indonesian texts 
define the mudra of Vairocana as bodhyagrt, which unequivocally proves 
that the yoga-tantras were prevalent in Indonesia.
2.3 Bosch identifies the Chandi Sewu as the Vajradhātu mandala, by con- 
paring the pantheon of the San hyan Nagabayusütra and Kalpabuddha with the 
Vajradhātu-mahamandala, the central mandala of the Japanese Vajradhātu 
(Jap. Kongokai). But he was beset with doubts by the fact that the maha- 
mandala was only "the central square of the mandala", a part of the whole, 
and how could a part be a gigantic monument that the Chandi Sewu is and 
was intended to be. It is essential to point out the circumstances in which 
the twin mandalas (Jap. genzu mandara) of Garbhadhātu and Vajradhātu were.
304

taken to Japan by Kobo daishi in A.D. 806. His master Hui-kuo had them
drawn for him on two scrolls. Different versions were synthesised on these 
two scrolls. The Japanese Vajradhātu mandala is not one mandala, but it 
is a collection of nine mandalas: comprising 6 types of Vajradhatu manda- 
Las, one Naya-mandala and two types of Trailokyavijaya mandalas. The 
three represent different subdivisions of the yoga-tantras. Within the 
yoga-tantras, there are two explanatory tantras from the upaya and prajnā 
standpoints. The Vajradhātu mandalas represent the Vajrasekhara which is 
explanatory tantra from the upaya standpoint. The naya-mandala represents 
the Naya-sutra which is explanatory from the prajna standpoint. The Trai- 
lokya-vijaya is explanatory from the upaya view of the second section 
(vajra-kula) of the Tattva-sangraha. In Tibet they are separate mandalas. 
The most important among them is the central mandala which is rightly 
termed a daimandara (=mahamandala), and is also known as the Jojin-ne (kā- 
ya-mandala) and karma-mandala in the Japanese tradition. Originally it was 
not the central part of a composite mandala, but it was the primary manda- 
la of the yoga-tantras, with an independent existence of its own. In the 
Niṣpannayogavall too it has an entity of its own.
Bosch is perfectly right in saying that Vajradhātu deities embody them- 
selves in the Sewu complex. Though its niches have been spoiled of their 
invaluable bronzes, but the entire plan is a confirmation. The central 
temple enshrined Vairocana, while the four surrounding cellas housed 
the other four Tathagatas Akṣobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amogha- 
siddha and their niches the parivara-devatas of each of the five Tatha- 
gatas. The east cella of Akşobhya was the antechamber whence the devotee 
entered the constellation of winding structures on his circumambulation 
(pradaksina). The deities of the Vajradhātu mandala were represented as 
follows:

36
Five Tathāgatas with their attendent deities 
puja-devis at the four corners of the buildings 
puja- and sangraha devis in the medium chapel
(remains of five have been laid bare)
The four rows of 240 subsidiary chapels house the Thousand Buddhas. 
Bosch surmises that thousand means 'very many' and 240 could suffice for 
a Thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa, "the founder of the complex 
erected 'merely' 240 sancturaries for harbouring the Buddhas of the Bha- 
drakalpa". This surmise is unnecessary. Each of the 240 subsidiary chapels 
housed 4 of the Thousand Buddhas, thus giving a total of 240 x 4 = 960 
Buddhas. It suited the architectural configuration of the chapels that 
one of the Thousand Buddhas be placed in the centre and three others in 
the niches in the three walls, while the fourth side remained empty be- 
cause of the entrance portal. The balance of 40 is as follows:
305

36deities in the central temple
4deities of the elements in the corners as in the Japanese 
Mahamandala
960 Thousand Buddhas
1000
The four deities, namely Tejas, Apaḥ, Vayu and Prithvi, are situated in 
the four corners of the Japanese mahamandala. These statues must have 
been placed in the corners of the enceinte under the open sky, or vesti- 
ges of lost chapels may be exhumed in future excavations. The expression 
Chandi Sewu can go back to the eighth century when the visualisation and 
construction of the gigantic ensemble took place.
2.4 Nañjuk Bronzes. Ever since their discovery in 1913 from desa Chandi 
Reja near Nañjuk (Kediri, East Java), these 90 bronzes have been the sub- 
8
ject of study. Krom studied 40 of them and at once came to the conclu- 
9
sion that they constituted a group. In 1929 Bosch rightly recognised 
them as the central Vajradhātu-mahamandala and he identified the pūjā- 
devis and four sangraha deities. The credit goes to K.W. Lim 10 
who right- 
ly perceived that the central deity belongs "to the Vajradhatu-mandala of 
the Anandagarbha-type". Anandagarbha is one of the three fundamental com- 
mentators on the Tattvas angraha, the basic scripture of the yoga-tantras. 
The Nañjuk bronzes must have formed part of a 37-deity Vajradhātu-manda- 
la of bronze statuettes. Along with the Chandi Sewu niches, it consti- 
tutes an important proof of the predominance of the Vajradhatu-mandala 
of the yoga-tantras in the Buddhism of Indonesia.
2.5 Nagarakṛtāgama 77.3 by Prapanca (A.D. 1365) enumerates the Budur 
as one of the important sanctums of the Vajradhara Buddhists (kasugatan 
kabajradharan) which was registered in the state archives. It is note- 
worthy that Budur is without the prefix bara. On the basis of the Nagara- 
krtagama, and the actual discovery of vajras on small sheets of gold, 
Bosch had clearly surmised, as early as 1920, that the Borobudur pertain- 
ed to the Vajradhara sect. The Vajradhara Buddhists were those who fol- 
lowed the yoga-tantras and their Lord was Vajradhara, while the Lord of 
the anuttara-yoga tantras Mahāvajradhara, who emanates all the deities 
in the Guhyasamaja-tantra. This distinction is relevant to. the precise 
evaluation of the Nagarakṛtāgama which is using 'vajradhara' as a spe- 
cialised technical term.
3. Etymology of the word Borobudur
3.1 As indicated by the Nāgarakṛtāgama, Budur was the main element of 
the compound Bara Budur. So bara should have a generic connotation of a 
sanctum. The possibility of bara being derived from vihara via Maly bi- 
11 
yara was mooted by Poerbatjaraka and Stutterheim. The linguistic dif- 
ficulties inherent in the transition from biyara to bara have stood in 
the way of its universal acceptance. But along with vihara there was the 
collateral form vahara which may be a mongeral term or an intentional
306

change to distinguish a tantric Buddhist monastic establishment from a
usual Buddhist monastery. The use of vahara (pronouced bahara) is attest- 
ed in the famous Nav bahār, the renowned Buddhist monastery at Balkh which 
was visited by the Chinese pilgrim Hsüan-tsang in about A.D. 630, and was 
12
damaged by the Arabs in A.D. 663-4. Hsüan-tsang translates bahar as mo- 
nastery (sanskritised as sanghārama by Julien and Beal).
3.2 The name of the Sogdian town of Bokhara (also spelt Bukhara) also 
goes back to the word vahara, which is made doubly probable by the dis- 
covery of a vihara near Numidikath, the predecessor town of Bokhara, The 
pronunciation Bokhara with o is a dialectical variation of the ancient 
vahara. The form Bokhara is attested in about 1666 as 'Bokara prunes' 
(Bernier, ed. Constable; 118). In the earliest document of 1221, the name 
13 
Occurs as Bachara.
developed into bahar and 
3.3 The lost colloquial Indic form vahara 
13 
about the ety- 
bokhar (a being pronounced as o). Pelliot's discussion 
mology of Bokhara does not take into account the possibility of the Indic 
form vahara, which is enhanced by the Newari term vahal for the Buddhist 
temples of Vajrayana in Nepal. The Indonesian bara, pronounced in Modern 
Javanese as boro can be traced back to bahara ba'ara (by the elision 
of h) <bara (coalescence of the two a). bara is influenced by vara 'ex- 
cellent', 'supreme'. In modern Tamil, h is a glide for hiatus, Murahari 
for Mura-ari (Murari). Conversely the h in bahara was considered an epen- 
thetic and dropped. The elision of intervovalic h is a widespread phe- 
nomenon in Tamil: e.g. ahamkara ankara, Mamalla Mahamalla, the great 
Pallava king who ruled at Kanchi (A.D. 630-668). Compare the modern Bali- 
nese Mendra for Mahendra.
3.4 There were a number of other Nav-bihar in Sind, at Samarkand, at 
Bokhara, and even at Ray (east of Tehran). I must confess that I do not 
14 
see why we have only "New monasteries in Iran". The presence of many 
Nav-bahar alludes to the fact that it was a generic term referring to 
esoteric Vajrayāna monasteries in general rather than a specific name. 
Thew Monasteries belonged to the New Way of Vajrayana Buddhism in 
contradistinction to Theravada and Mahāyāna.
The prevalence of Vajrayana in Iranian Central Asia is attested by (i) 
Vajrayana texts in the Iranian-speaking domains of Khotan like the Adhyar- 
15
which is a text of the yoga-tantric system. dhasatika prajñāpāramita 
(11) The Avatamsaka, whose presiding Buddha is Vairocana and which is a 
precursor to the carya and yoga tantras, was in vogue at Khotan. The 
T'ang Empress Wu tsö-t'ien (684-705) had sent a special envoy to Khotan 
for the Sanskrit text of his sutra. (iii) Subhakarasimha (637-735), who 
was the first great master of Vajrayana in China, has bequethed to us 
the Rita-sogy ara-gobu-shingan (Jap. pronunciation) which illustrates six 
mandalas of Rta-samhära or Tattva-sangraha. Its drawings are in the hand 
of an Iranian-speaking disciple as is evident from the Sassanoid coronets
307

of the deities and from the colophon acarya-ért-Baubhtik Jasya surataḥ
where surataḥ is the Iranian word surat 'picture'. (iv) Amoghavajra (705- 
774) whose mother hailed from Samarkand, translated yoga-tantric texts 
into Chinese, with the help of Hui-lin from Kashgar. Besides, five dis- 
ciples from Samarkand (K' ang), Tashkent (Shih), Tukhara (Lo), and Betik 
(Pi) are mentioned in his Memorial of A.D. 767. In another Memorial dated 
A.D. 768 he requested permission to tonsure three disciples from Tukha-

The Tun-huang resident asks "which book do you like". The bhiksu 
16
Khotan replies: "I like Vajrayāna". The presence of Vajrayana in Ira- 
nian-speaking Central Asia was thus a wide-spread phenomenon and the New 
Monasteries represented it.
3.5 Central Asia has preserved a distinction between earlier monaste- 
ries with their austere statuary and ascetic discipline and the new Vaj- 
rayana monasteries in their splendour of ritual and graceful images of 
gods eternally young and of charming goddesses.
BIruni (Athar al-baglya, ed. E. Sachau, p. 206) considers behär 
farxar synonymous, but Al-Khwarizmi (Mafatih al- u' lum, p. 123) clearly 
distinguishes them semantatically: "buhar is the idol temple of India and 
farxar is the idol-temple of China and Upper Sughd or Sogdiana" (Richard 
N. Frye, Notes on the history of Transoxiana, HJAS. 19 [1956]. 115. n. 52). 
Al-Khwarizmi in all probability preserves a distinction in the denomina- 
tional context of the two terms which though confused later on were once 
contradistinctive.
3.6 The second element of the name Budur, has been unconvincingly de- 
17 
rived from Malay budua, or Sk. Buddha. Moens has rightly come to the 
conclusion that -ur is the South Indian suffix for a city, settlement. In 
Tamil putu/budu means 'new', and putür refers to a 'new settlement'. There 
18
is a town called Budoor in the Chingleput district in South India, and 
eight towns with the name Pudur, and Pudur-palayam, Pudur-Ramnad, Pudur- 
Uthamanur, not to mention about a hundred city names with Pudu-. Thus the 
word Budur is the Tamil term for a new settlement, and Bara Budur means 
the New Monasteries or Nava-vihara like its Central Asian counterparts of 
the contemporary period.
3.7 A Tamil designation for the greatest Sailendra monument is no won- 
der. The Javanese-Balinese script itself is derived from that of the Pal- 
lavas. In all likelihood the Vajrayana of the Sailendras was derived from 
Southern India. There are a number of traces in the Sailendra monuments 
which stem from Tamil nuances of phonetics and vocabulary. From the ruins 
19
of Chandi Sewu a fragmentary inscription bears the words: tiruranu. Cas-
308

paris considers it to be the designation of an official. Tamil tiru is
ért, and ranu corresponds to Tamil ranuvam 'army' (Tamil Lexicon 6.3423). 
20
It may refer to king Samaratunga, who reigned 812-832. It could have 
been his pet family name (tiru=sri, ranuva-samara).
The inscription of Sri Kahulunnan dated Saka 764 = A.D. 842, which is 
correlated to the Borobudur by Casparis, begins with the date and the day
is canais carawara21 
(Casparis, p. 86), instead of sa. Ca in place of sa is
a common phenomenon in Tamil, where sani is cani.
A highly significant phrase occurs in the beginning of the two inscrip- 
tions:
I line 4
sima nin kamulän i bhumi sambhāra.
II lines 2, 3
sima nin kamulan <i bhumi> sambhara
Casparis has rightly come to the conclusion that the phrase refers to 
the Borobudur complex, on the analysis of the village names occuring in 
the inscription. But his interpretation of the word kamulan has to be 
viewed in a new light. Kamulan is a homonymic counterpart of mulasthana, 
where ka- -an denote sthana. In Tamil this word occurs as mula-t-ta- 
nam (from mula-sthāna) 'sanctum sanctorum of a temple' (Tamil Lexicon). 
Tiru-mulattanam (tiru-éri+mulasthāna) refers to the sacred shrine of 
Tiruvarur (Tamil Lexicon, p. 1913). The compound bhumi sambhara is a pro- 
per name, a toponym. It means the 'land/Country of the sambhara'. With it 
we may compare the geographic name Bumi-ayu in Brebes, Central Java, when- 
ce a bronze of seated Tārā has been discovered with a Sanskrit inscrip- 
tion. It may be noted that the vowel length in the two inscriptions varies 
-sambhara and sambhara. In Tamil sambara refers to the Buddhist communi- 
ty. Sambara is samvara meaning 'the Buddhist vows'. The transition from 
sambara to sambhara was an orthographic variation where bh lent the word 
dignity of hypersanskritism. It could also have been influenced by the 
Buddhist term sambhara (punya-sambhara, etc. in the Dharmasangraha 117). 
Thus bhumi sambhara meant the land of the sambhara, i.e. Buddhists. The 
whole expression kamulan i bhumi sambhara means a monastic foundation of 
Buddhists'. It is pertinent to cite the lead-bronze inscription discover- 
ed on the plain west of the Borobudur, which refers to a locus on a hill 
of the southern region (daksinaputhasya parvvatasthale). Boechari (Preli- 
minary report on some archaeological finds around the Borobudur temple, 
cyclostyled paper, 1976, p. 11) poses the question "Does this text refer 
to the Borobudur?". We feel that it does. Daksinapatha in Sanskrit is 
South India: the same as bhumi sambhara; parvatasthala should refer to the 
Borobudur, the replica of Mount Sumeru. The Borobudur is in the village 
Bumisegoro (Skt. sagara-bhumi) which alludes to it as the settlement of 
people beyond the seas, i.e. India. In stanza 8 of the Kalasan inscription 
of Saka 70022, the Sailendras do term themselves arya-santati. As late as
309

the 11th century, Sailendras had intimate relations with South India: they
founded a vihara at Nagapattinam, to which the Chola King granted the in- 
come of a village for support.
4. Morphological elements of the Borobudur
4.1 The Borobudur was a vihara: it is attested by the Inscription of 
23
Karangtěñah of A.D. 824 (line 15: astām vihara). The presence of the 
vihāra has beer proved by archaeological excavations. Its remains were 
24
found to the Northwest of the monument. It had a number of structures 
of which the monument now famous as the Borobudur was one, most probably 
in the centre of the ordering of the entire sanctified space. The same in- 
scription speaks of vividha gana-samākrānta-murttis-ca meruḥ in the pre- 
vious line 23: namely, the gods reside on the Meru/Sumeru, an implicit al- 
lusion pregnant with significance for the structural definition of the Bo- 
robudur. The pyra 1 architecture of the Borobudur with its square ter- 
races, three super-imposed concentric platforms crowned by a finial - 
without a clearly marked entrance but flights of steps on four sides has 
puzzled scholars who have tried to designate it a stupa.
4.2 The plan of the Borobudur is: -5 terraces, supporting 3 circular 
platforms adorned with 72 latticed campanulae, surrounding a larger cen- 
tral stupa on a final and ninth terrace. The first five terraces are the 
five storeys of Sumeru, as we find in Nepalese temples, Tibetan texts and 
thanka paintings. In Nepal, the tradition of temples on a stepped pysamid- 
al base has continued down to our times. The best known of such temples or 
dega is the five-storeyed temple of the Newars at Bhaktapur, the Nyatapola 
dega. It stands on a five-stepped pyramid.
25
4.3 Prof. Wayman has illustrated the configuration of the Sumeru on 
aTibetan scroll (thanka). It has five terraces which constitute Mount 
Sumeru (p. 108). Above the five-storeyed Sumeru is a cloud atop which rests 
a three-storeyed palace. On top of the palace roof is a tiny structure. 
This becomes clear in Mkhas-grub-rje's (A.D. 1385-1438) fundamentals of 
26 
the Buddhist tantras. In his prescription" of the generation of the re- 
sidence (adharotpatti) he says: "In the middle of this [ocean], he ima- 
gines a four-sided Sumeru mountain, adorned on all four sides with rows
of stairs made [respectively) of gold silver, sapphire (indranila) and 
amber, all over which spring up wish-granting trees (kalpa-vrksa) decorat- 
ed with a thousand fluttering victory banners.
Above it, he is to imagine a canopy (vitāna) appearing in an instant. 
On top of that [canopy], he generates the complete characteristics of an 
eaved palace (kuṭāgāra) and generates within it various seats; and he may 
also generate within the palace stūpas of the varieties 'victorious' and 
'radiant' (p. 175). Thereafter, the deities are invited to be resident 
(adheya) in the sanctified space.
310

This scheme corresponds to the Borobudur as follows:
5 terraces = five storeys of the Sumeru
3 circular platforms = base of kūṭāgāra (palace)
1 large central finial = stūpa
4.4 There must have been a wooden pavilion (kūṭāgāra) atop the three 
circular platforms. We know that Borobudur had wooden structures which 
have perished. Octagonal stone bases of the foundations of the monastic 
building have been found to the west of the monument. The discovery of 
27
bronze nails points that the building was of wood. The pinnacle seems 
to have been octagonal and ended in a number of horizontal incisions, three 
28 
parasols in succession and a jewel at the top. The horizontal incisions 
in the pinnacle must have held the wooden kuṭāgāra, and other architectu- 
ral end-elements.
4.5 The Borobudur is a mandala dedicated to Vairocana of the Vajradhā- 
tu. The abode of Vairocana is atop Sumeru as it is clearly pointed out 
in the Nispanna-yogāvalī in the chapter on the Vajradhātu-manḍala that 
Lord Vairocana is seated in the vajraparyanka posture in the centre of 
the kūṭāgāra situated on Sumeru: Sumerupari kūṭāgaram tasya madhye 
vibvambhojasya karnikāyām bhagavan Vairocano (text p. 44 § 19). In 
the Japanese tradition of the Kongōchōkyō (Vajrasekhara-tantra) Vairocana 
29
ascended Mount Sumeru to reveal the mandala to sentient beings. In nis 
work on the fundamentals of the tantras, Mkhas-grub-rje says: After com- 
pleting the five abhisambodhi, he became samyaksambuddha Mahāvairocana, 
30
proceeded to the summit of Mount Sumeru and proclaimed the yoga tantras, 
that is, the Tattvasañgraha, its explanatory Vajrasekhara-tantra and oth-
er Lantras.
4.6 The Vairocana Buddhas on the three circular platforms are in lat- 
ticed stupus. There is a clear difference between the stupas on the first 
and second rows and those on the third. The pinnacles of the first two 
rows are supported by square bases, while those of the third by octago- 
nal bases. The perforations in the first case are lozenges, and those in 
the other are squares:
1st and 2nd rows basesquare lozenge-shaped perforations
3rd row
octagonal base square perforations
This divergence can be traced back to the Avatamsaka-sutra which gave rise 
to the carliest iconographical type of Vairocana in the art of Khotan and 
China. In a passage describing cosmological interrelationship it is stated 
that transformations of the Buddha exist sometimes in the form of Mount 
Sumeru, of circle-nets,of all square things, ...and of all sorts 
of ornamentation, circles, forms neither square nor circular, and tri- 
angles. Thus geometric forms are specifically mentioned in the text as 
forms in which the Buddha sometimes manifests. These geometric elements 
are actually painted on the body of Vairocana in the paintings of Khotan.
311

4.7 The 72 latticed stupas enshrining the Vairocana Buddhas in the Bo-
robudur represent the architectonic transcreation of the stupas depicted 
on the body of Vairocana in the Avatamsaka tradition as can be seen in the 
mural fragments from Khotan. The mural fragment Kuduk-tol .025 shows a 
stupa with a high superstructure, the legs of Bremen A 16164 have a very 
elongated stupa of several stories with harmika, the left lower leg of 
panel D.IV.4 abv. (British Museum) shows a stupa with high superstructure, 
31 
and so on. What were oddities as representations on the body of Vairo- 
cana himself were integrated into the grace of an architectural composi- 
tion by the brilliant architect that Gunadharma was, who conceived the Bo- 
32
robudur in the contemplative solitudes of Mount Menoreh. 
5. The Thousand Buddhas on the Borobudur
5.1 A glance over the complete set of 132 Tibetan mandalas of the 
Rgyude-sde kun-btus comprising all the classes of tantras reveals that only the 
vajradhatu-mandala, which follows down to every minor detail the Tibetan 
translation of the Sanskrit text, is the classical mandala with 1037 
33
deities.
5.2 In the Brahmajala-sutra (Jap. Bommokyo, Chin. Fan-wang-ching) trans- 
lated by Kumarajiva in A.D. 406 it is said: "I am called Vairocana (Jap. 
Roshana) and live in the ocean of the lotus world 
...I incarnate myself 
into one thousand Buddhas". The Thousand Buddhas were, thus, an integral 
aspect of Mahāvairocana as early as the fourth century.
5.3 In the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, the Kanjur, the Bhadrakalpika-sutra 
which describes the Thousand Buddhas, precedes Lalitavistara the biogra- 
phy of Buddha. At the Borobudur, too, the Lalitavistara is depicted be- 
sides half the Thousand Buddhas.
5.4 The Japanese Vajradhātu mahamandala follows the classical norm in 
34 
representing each one of the Thousand Buddhas in the second enceinte.
5.5 A Javanese chronicle does refer to the thousand statues at Boro- 
budur: "a story occurs in a fragment of a Javanese chronicle published by 
Poensen (BKI. 1901, p. 287) which pertains to the adventures of a Java- 
nese crown-prince who died in the year 1758. In this story it is said that 
the crown-prince, after a life of dissipation, went to the Borobudur to 
visit the thousand statues of this sanctuary, after which visit he soon 
fell ill and died".

Frédéric 35
5.6 
counts the Buddha statues at Borobudur as follows:
Buddhas in themudrāresemble
92Eastbhumi-sparsa[Akṣobhya]
92SouthvaradaCRatnasambhava]
92Westdhyana[Amitabha]
92Northabhaya[Amoghasiddhi J
64fourth galleryvitarka
72latticed stupasdharma-cakra[Vairocana]
504
These 504 Buddhas, when doubled, make the sacred number of 504 x 2 = 1008. 
5.7 It is interesting to note the pattern of variation in the depiction 
of the Thousand Buddhas in the Bhadrakalpika-sutra. In the 
Lhasa xylograph of this sutra which was woodprinted at the Zhöparkhang 
printery of the Potala Palace of the Dalai Lama as the authentic version, 
we find the illustrations of all the Thousand Buddhas with their names in 
versified stanzas. They are represented as Buddhas in the dharma-cakra, 
bhumi-spará, varada, dhyana and abhaya mudrās in this very order. This 
mudra sequence is repeated 200 times to arrive at the number of a thousand, 
without any other change. At Borobudur, too, the same pattern is repre- 
sented. To use the nomenclature of the Pañca-Tathāgata, namely, Akşobhya, 
Ratnasambhava, Amithaba, Amoghasiddhi and Vairocana, is inappropriate and 
misleading as each of the Thousand Buddhas has an individual name though 
their iconography is restricted to five forms which is common to the Pan- 
ca-Tathāgata. The description of the Borobudur has to undergo a total ter- 
minological revolution for the correct identification of the whole as well 
as of its constituent elements.
5.8 The Vajradhātu becomes a mahamandala because of the Thousand Bud- 
dhas, which is its unique and contradistinctive attribute in the world of 
tantric mandalas. The Vajradhātu mahāmaṇḍala added to the already existing 
five forms of the Buddhas a sixth one with the vitarka mudra. These six 
forms of Buddhas were repeated 169 times to the auspicious number of 1008 
(168 x 6 = 1008). That is why there are 504 Buddhas, and the niches and 
stupas enclosing these 504, symbolically make up the requisite double 
number 504 x 2 = 1008. Thus the six forms of Buddhas on the main walls 
and circular terraces do not stand for Akṣobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, 
Amoghasiddhi, -and Vairocana, but are simply six morphological types
to delineate the 1008 Buddhas in 168 cyclic repetitions in sixes (168 x 
6 = 1008). It was never realised that the neglected iconography of the 
Thousand Buddhas held a key to the Borobudur. It has been ignored so far 
as a tautology.
313

6. Central image of the Borobudur
6.1 The central image of the Borobudur enshrined in the final stupa 
has not been found, and its absence has engendered a continued controver- 
sy. The intrusion of the unfinished image has complicated the issue. Its 
solutions have varied according to the interpretation of the type of Bud- 
dhism represented by the Borobudur.
6.2 In the early period of its discovery it was "a huge mass of stones 
enveloping the top of a hill and containing only a small room in its cen- 
36 
tral dagob". Kempers (p. 48-49) summarises the situation in the follow- 
ing words: "Inside the central dagob there is a large cella with, a smaller 
one above it. During the whole of the 19th century there was a large hole 
in the walls of the dagob. An unfinished statue of a Buddha has been found 
inside the cella. It is exactly like those of the other Buddha images which 
show the attitude of 'touching the earth' (in the niches facing the east). 
Much controversy has arisen around this 'unfinished Buddha'. According to 
some it represents the Supreme Buddha manifesting himself incompletely in 
this manner. On the other hand there is reason to suppose that the sculp- 
tor left his work unfinished because of a mistake he made in carving one 
to be too much of a failure to figure as of the hands. Anyhow, it seems 
the Supreme Buddha. It may have been introduced into the cella through 
the hole in its walls for some reason unknown to us. The same goes for a 
number of smaller objects found in the same place, such as a small kris" 
We agree with Kempers that the unfnished statue was secretely introduced 
in the cella to compensate the disappearance of the golden image of Mahā 
vairocana enshrined therein, though Stutterheim p. 56 feels: "Hoepermans 
statement is no more than an insinuation directed against the Resident 
and the Regent, reproaching the former with the theft of a small golden 
image found during the investigations, and the later for having played the 
role of henchman by having this substituted by the first Buddha statue tc 
be found in the vicinity".
6.3 The golden age of Buddhism at Nagapattinam was the 8-9th century. 
The central image of the Buddhist vihara in this city was made of solid 
gold. The Vaisnava saint Alvar Tiru-mangai wanted to renovate the Ranga- 
natha temple of Srirangam. "He hit upon the idea of robbing the Buddhist 
vihara at Nagapattinam of its Buddha image of solid gold. In this project, 
the information given by an old Vaisnava lady residing at Nagapattinam 
was very useful. It was to this effect: "The sthapathi who made this gold- 
den image and the Vimana under which it is enshrined lives at present in 
Dvipäntara". This statement was enough to send Tiru-mangai to DvIpantara 
where he had no great difficulty in identifying the house of the cele- 
brated artist and architect and getting him, by a ruse, to surrender the 
secret of the construction of the vimana, which enabled the Alvar to enter 
37 
the temple stealthily and remove the golden image according to plan"."
314

The word pattinam itself denotes asettlement of sambaras, i.e. those who
paid allegiance to Buddhist monks and were rich maritime merchants. A gold- 
en image was a lure as early as the 9th century, for howsoever noble a pur- 
pose, and why should it not be in the 19th century. It is not an isolated 
phenomenon. "According to unconfirmed stories dating from the colonial 
period, there were villages near the Dieng Plateau which paid their taxes 
38 in golden statues, the most precious produce of their soil". We do not
know their whereabouts.
6.4 The sthapati referred to above could have been responsible for the 
creation of the central image of the Borobudur. Even if there was some 
other sthapati, he could have hailed from India. The sthapati were in the 
Land of Gold, in Suvarnabhumi, and they would have insisted for a statue 
of solid gold for such a magnificent monument as the Borobudur, when there 
was a precedent in the main image of the vihara at Nagapattinam being of 
gold. A bronze statue of Vairocana, covered with hammered gold leaf, has 
been found from Sidorejo (Central Java). It can be assigned to about the 
ninth century. Significantly enough it bears a stylistic affinity with 
39 
South Indian sculpture. The cumulative effect of the evidence adduced so 
far indicates that the central image should have been of solid gold and 
consequently small in size.
6.5 Paragraph 1.4 details the two concomitant steps of Vajrayana wor- 
ship: (i) generation of the residence for the deities (adhāra) and (11) 
evocation of the deities to be residents (adheya) therein. The entire ar- 
chitectural composition of the Borobudur down to the minute details of the 
geometric designs of the lattices of the stupas on the circular platforms, 
favours, sustains and strenghtens the idea that it is an adhara for the 
mandala of Vajradhātu Vairocana. The first stage is to be followed by the 
second stage (adheya) of the 37 deities of the Vajradhātu mandala taking 
residence herein: the central image of Vairocana surrounded by 36 deities. 
The images of these 36 deities must have been fashioned out of seven or 
nine precious metals. They should have been placed in the now-vanished 
wooden kuṭāgāra.
The dichotomy of the adhara and adheya was reflected in the construc- 
tion itself: adhara was a fixed and permanent construction in stone and 
the adheya or the images of precious metal were portable who 'take' re- 
sidence in every ritual - true to hieratic requirements.
The 'unfinished image' is a sculptor's error, without any place in the 
scheme of the Borobudur. All the confusion has arisen because scholars were 
not aware of the basic fact that NO unfinished, faulty, or broken image is 
ever istalled in a sacred place.
7. Correlation of the reliefs to the central deity Vairocana
In paragraph 1.6 we have dealt with the different strata of Buddhist 
thought leading to the Vajradhātu Vairocana of the yoga-tantras. These
315

have been harmonized in the consecutively ascending sculptural components
of the consummate architecture of the Borobudur.
7.1 The monastic complex of Tabo in Himachal Pradesh in India was con- 
secrated to Vajradhātu Vairocana, by Rin-chen-bzań-po in the 10th century. 
Its central mandala hall is dedicated to Vairocana. Beneath the 37 images 
of the mandala there are frescoes of the life of Sakyamuni on the right 
wall, and those of the pilgrimage of Sudhana along the left wall. The in- 
trinsic proximity of Avatamsaka and of the mandala of Vairocana is thus 
reflected in the depiction of Sudhana's pilgrimage as a historical sub- 
stratum in the onward spiritual journey to the mandala of Vairocana. The 
entire Tabo complex is surrounded by a wall with 108 stupas. Both 'the 
series of the life of Sakyamuni and the journey of Sudhana are also sculpt- 
ed at Borobudur. A number of stupas have been found at a distance from the 
Borobudur. These may have topped the ramparts of the Borobudur complex.
7.2 The Borobudur has reliefs drawn from the Karma-vibhanga, Lalita- 
vistara, jätakas, avadānas and from the Avatamsaka text of the Gandavyuha 
ending in the Bhadracari. Karma-vibhanga represents the most fundamental 
level of the operation of karmic cause-and-effect. The jätakas and ava- 
danas are the perennial effort of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas to liberate 
from the bonds of karmic causation, and Lalitavistara is the immortal sto- 
ry of Buddha śākyamuni's discovery of the noble eightfold path. The whole 
represents the graduated path from the inexorable laws of karma (Karma- 
vibhanga), its cessation by the path leading upto Buddha Sakyamuni as pro- 
pounded in the Lalitavistara, to its sophistication in Avatamsaka (Ganda- 
vyuha) where Sudhana the eternal pilgrim is exhorted by Mañjuśrī to re- 
sort to Samantabhadra whose great vow (Bhadracari) is to reach the Para- 
dise of Amitabha (Ratnakuṭa), and transcending them all is Supreme Buddha 
40
become Abhisambuddha.

BOROBUDUR AS A MONUMENT OF ESOTERIC BUDDHI SM
Lokesh Chandra
International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi (India)
The precise nature of the complex of 1+8+240 buildings of 
the Chandi Sewu, near Chandi Kalasan, in the village of 
Prambanan near Yogyakarta the cultural capital of Indonesia, 
has hardly been determined in a definitive manner taking into 
account the Indonesian Buddhist texts, their texture within 
the classification of vajrayana tantras, the context of the 
cultural interflow between India and Indonesia during the epoch 
when the Chandi Sewu was constructed, the theory of architectonic 
constellations expressing dimensions of the tantric vision, 
the abundant Nepalese textual evidence hidden away in 
unpublished manuscripts, collateral artistic expressions of 
identical/parallel cosmograms in the Himalayan regions, and 
the multiplicity of Japanese traditions about the Vajradhātu 
mandalas. The utilisation of original texts in Sanskrit or 
Tibetan or Sino-Japanese and comparative studies of the same 
theme in different traditions as preserved in manuscripts over 
vast regions of Asia has been steadily declining in the emerging 
order of over-generalisation at the expense of precision. 
Though F.D.K. Bosch (1961:111-133) had come to a correct but 
halting assessment about the appropriate identification of the 
Chandi Sewu as early as 1929, later scholars have hardly 
verified or elaborated his hesitant conclusions, and on the 
contrary they have relegated the Sewu to the undefined. 
Frits A. Wagner (1962:114) is simplistic in terming the central 
statue to "have been a bronze Buddha" instead of Vai ro cana, 
Further he states: "The whole construction, symbolising the 
cosmos, mandala, was intended to assist the hermit in his 
meditations". The mandala is not named and its primary function 
was not meditation for which a painted mandala is the norm.

2
Louis Frédéric (1965: 163 pl.182) is again imprecise in stating 
and probably 
that "this temple, dedicated to Buddha, 
symbolising the Mahayana pantheon". Buddha generally refers to 
Sakyamuni and not to Vairo cana. The pantheon here is vajrayanic 
and therein too it belongs to a very specific tantric text. 
A. J. Bernet Kempers (1959:56 pl.130) is correct but cautions in 
saying: "The central shrine of the main temple appears to have 
contained an image of the Highest Buddha as the central figure 
of an elaborate pantheon, presumably a Vajradhatu-mandala". 
Jan Fontein, R. Soekmono, Satyawati Suleiman (1971:144 pl.4) 
feel that "it is impossible to reconstruct the iconographic 
plan of Tjandi Sewu. It is likely, however, that the assembled 
statues formed a huge Diamond Ma trix Mandala (Vajradhātu-manala)". 
Vajradhātu-mahamandala whose niches 
The Sewu is an architectonic 
are a sure guide to its iconography th ough all its stone and 
bronze statues have disappeared 'within the memory of man', 
including the central statue of Mahavai ro cana the fragments of 
whose head were discovered in 1927.

A few general observations about the precise 
of Vajrayana Buddhism that was prevalent in Indonesia would 
help in clarifying the context. Before doing so we will have 
to consider the classification of Vajrayana tantras into four 
broad divisions of: (i) kriya-tantras, (ii) carya-tantras, 
(iii) yoga-tantras, and (v) anuttara-yoga tantras. Each
division is presided over by a different Buddha.They are as
follows:
Ami tayus
kriya-tantras
Vairocanabhi sambodhi 
carya-tantras
(one face, dhyana mudra) 
Sarvavid Vairocana
yoga-tantras
(four faces, cakra in hand) 
anuttara yogi (father) tantrasGuhyasamaja Aksobhya
Cakrasaivara
anuttara yogini (mother) tantras
Every division has its fundamental and explanatory tantra. In 
Indonesia the teaching of yoga-tantras was prevalent. So also

3
in Japan. That was the vogue in South India whence they were 
transmitted to both these countries. we shall cite 
Rgyud-sde spyihi rnam-par-gzhag-pa rgyas-par brjod, a survey of 
the entire field of tantra in terms of bibliography and basic 
ideas, by the great Tibetan master of tantras, Mkhas-grub-rje 
who lived from 1385-1438. He clarifies (Lessing/Wayman 1968:25) 
that the teaching of the yoga division of tantras is set forth 
in "two works, the fundamental tantra Tattvas angraha (Toh.479), 
and the explanatory tantra Vajrasekhara (Toh.480). They have 
primary commentaries by three men who are famed in India as 
being learned in Yoga, namely, Sakyamitra, Buddhaguhya, and 
Anandagarbha. Buddhaguhya, who wrote the fundamental commentary 
Tantrarthavatara (Toh.2501) on the Tattvas ang raha lived in the 
middle of the eighth century as is attested by his letter 
(Toh.4194) to the Tibetan King Khri-sron-ldeḥu-bts an who reigned 
from A.D. 755. His date is important as it lends weight to the 
fact that the eighth century was the golden age of yoga-tantras, 
a fact corroborated by other historic events.
The yoga-tantras have five families (kula : tathagata, 
ratna, padma, karma, and vajra. Their kulesa's are: Vairocana, 
Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi and Akṣobhya. The deities 
created by his mudra are the progeny (kulika, Lessing/Wayman 
1968:102-3).Among them the Tathagata-family of Vairocana is
the highest.In the anuttara yoga-tantras, Vajradhara is added 
as the sixth family and he is the highest. This was further 
elaborated in the 'Mother Tantras' of the anut tara-yogim- 
tantras by the addition of a seventh family (dakinis). In 
Indonesia we find only five families in the San hyan Nagabayu- 
sutra and Kalpabuddha (Bosch 1929: 131-3), besides the expression 
pañca-tathāgata in Kalpabuddha (p.133) and elsewhere. No statue 
which can be specifically attributed to the anuttara-yoga-tani. 
has been found in Indonesia. The anuttara division of tantras 
probably did not reach Indonesia and never came to vogue in 
China and Japan. It became popular in Tibet where it reached

its apogee of development. Whenever a comparison of Indonesian
iconography with that of Tibet is resorted to this fundamental 
fact has to be borne in mind.
Bosch has proved the close affinity of Indonesian Buddhist 
iconography with the Shingon iconography of Japan. It is but 
natural that the two traditions should agree as they represent 
the same yoga-tantra school of Buddhism. The basic tantra of 
this school was carried to China by Vajrabodhi who arrived in

the son of the Royal Preceptor (rajaguru) of Kanchi. 
they encountered a storm just twenty days before they reached 
Canton. All the thirty odd ships were lost, except that which 
carried Vajrabodhi, who saved it by his recitation of 
Mahapratisara-dharani. In the confusion that ensued, Vajrabodhi 
forgot to save the complete text of the Vajrasekhara-tantra of 
which the abridged version was preserved. This is the text he 
translated into Chinese and introduced its Vajradhātu mandala, 
which is a collocation of nine mandalas namely, the Vajradhātu- 
mahamandala, samaya-mandala, sukṣma-mandala, puja-mandala, 
caturmudra-mandala, ekamudra-mandala, naya-mandala,
Trailokyavi jaya-karma-mandala, Trailokyavi jaya-samaya-mandala. 
The central Vajradhātu mahamandala is also known as the karma-

mandala or under its Japanese name of Jojinne.
sect in Japan only the Jojinne mandala is used: that is, it 
does not form a part of another mandala but it is independent 
and primary.
As Vajrabodhi carried the Vajrasekhara-tantra of the 
yoga-tantra division, it must have been the most prevalent 
school at Kanchi. There were close trade and cultural relations
between the South and Srivijaya. The shipping routes to China 
from the South went via śrīvijaya. Vajrabodhi visited Srivijaya 
on his way to Canton. A colony of Buddhists from śrīvijaya 
resided at Nagapattinam, where they erected two Buddhist temples 
at the beginning of the eleventh century with the patronage of

5
Cola kings.The golden age of Buddhism at Nagapattinam was the 
8-9th century. The central image of the Buddhist vihara in this 
city was made of solid gold. The Vaisnava saint Alvar Tiru- 
mangai wanted to renovate the Ranganatha temple of Srirangam. 
"He hit upon the idea of robbing the Buddhist Vihara at 
Nagapattinam of its Buddha image of solid gold. In this project, 
the information given by an old Vaisnava lady residing at 
Nagapattinam was very useful. It was to this effect : "The 
sthapati who made this golden image and the Vimana under which 
11
This statement it is enshrined lives at present in dvi pantara. 
was enough to send Tiru-mangai to dvi pantara where he had no 
great difficulty in identifying the house of the celebrated 
artist and architect and getting him, by a ruse, to surrender 
the secret of the construction of the vimana, which enabled the 
Alvar to enter the temple stealthily and remove the golden image 
according to plan (Ramachandran 1954: 15). The word pattinam 
itself denotes a settlement of sambaras, i.e. those who paid 
allegiance to Buddhist monks and were rich maritime merchants. 
The aforesaid event attests flourishing communications between 
India and Indonesia in the eighth century. During this period 
yoga-tantra Buddhism was well-established in the Pallava domains 
as is attested by the fact that Vajrabodhi transmitted the 
yoga-tantra Vajrasekhara to East Asia in the beginning of this 
century. It is but natural that the division of Buddhist tantras 
that was transmitted to Indonesia must have been the yoga-tantras. 
The Chandi Sewu belongs to this century. An inscription dated 
792 was found on the site of Candi Sewu, which suggests that 
its construction commenced thereabout. No wonder that the 
Sewu embodied the great philosophical system of yoga-tantras 
in its architecture. Architectonic mandalas are known as 
pura-mandala as distinct from rajo-mandala drawn with powdered 
colours or pata-mandala painted on textiles.
After these preliminary observations, let us consider the 
article of Bosch (1929:111-133) on the identification of the

6
Sewu. He commences by mentioning Buddhist texts like the San 
Hyan Nagabayu-sutra and Kalpabuddha besides the well-known San 
Hyan Kamahāyānikan. The first two have rightly been recognised
by Bosch as deriving their value by "mentioning the names of 
the five Dhyani buddhas and some of their principal attributes 
and characteristics" (p.113). He has also pointed out their 
close relationship and that they are complementary to each 
other. He further surmised that these two texts "had their 
common origin in the texts of the same sect or school". With 
advances in the analysis of the interrelationship of the vast 
mass of Tantric literature on the basis of Tibetan works of 
great masters like Bu-ston, Tson-kha-pa and others it has 
become possible to define the precise division of tantras to 
which the two Indonesian texts belong. As already detailed 
the tantras were classified in four major divisions in ancient 
India, Nepal, Tibet and elsewhere. The details of this 
classification have not only been preserved, commented upon at 
length, but is still a living tradition among Tibetans. It 
supplies us with all the requisite data to assign the precise 
school to the Indonesian text and also determine the major 
manifestation of the division in question as an iconographic 
representation in the form of a mandala either on cloth or in 
an architectural form. Out of the four divisions of tantras 
there are two whose central deity is Vairocana, namely, the 
carya-tantras and yoga-tantras. The carya-tantras are 
represented by the texts of Mahavai rocan -abhi sambodhi-vikurvit- 
adhisthana-vai pulya-sutrendra-raja (Toh.494 Sino-Japanese 
text T.848-Nj.530) and the Acala-kalpa (Toh.495). The major 
1 
texts of the yoga-tantras are the Tattva-sangraha¹ and its 
explanatory tantra entitled the Vajrasekhara. Vai ro cana has 
separate and distinctive forms in these two divisions of 
tantras in the yoga-tantras he is in the bodhyagri-nudrā 
while in the carya-tantras he is in dhyana-mudra. Both the se 
forms are clearly delineated in the Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan

7
and Sino-Japanese traditions. The iconography can be seen, for 
instance in the Vajradhatu and Garbhadhatu mandalas² of the 
Shingon tradition: the Vajradhātu Vairocana is in the bodhyagri 
mudra while the Garbhadhātu Vairocana is in the dhyana-mudra. 
Both the Indonesian texts define the mudra of Vairocana as 
bodhyagri, which unequivocally proves that the Tantric school 
which was prevalent in Indonesia was that of the yoga-tantras. 
In the Ni spanna-yogaval (Bhattacharyya 1949:44-47 of text) 
the iconography of the Vajradhatu-mandala is described in 
details following the Vajrasekhara-tantra. The central deity 
can be either (1) a four-faced eight-armed Vairocana or 
(11) one-faced two-armed Vairocana both in the bodhyagri mudra 
which is described as the left fore-finger in the vajra-fist 
(vajra-musti) being enclosed by the right vajra-fist: vame 
vajra-mustes tarjanya utthitaya daksine vajra-mustina grahane 
sati bodhyang mudra (p.44). Bosch had intuitively written : 
"a point demanding a moment's attention is the name of the 
mudra of Vairocana which in both manuscripts reads bodhyagri 
mudra, the same mudra that is mentioned in the Adikarmaprad pa 
and in the Oldjavanese Arjunawijaya and Sutasoma" (p.115). It
demanded not a moment's attention but was crucial to the 
identification of the specific school of Vai ro cana in Indonesia 
and consequently of his mandala. The intuition of Bosch is 
striking indeed.
Bosch (p.116) raises the question of the paradise's of 
the Five Tathāgatas. He says: "Although the rigid parallelism 
prevailing in all matters concerning the Tathagatas would lead 
us to expect that to the other Dhyani buddhas a heaven of their 
own would have been assigned as well, it is noteworthy that 
nowhere in buddhist literature mention is made of these heavens. 
The mahayanist sources thus being silent on this point, it is 
rather surprising to find the complete set of five paradises 
in both Balinese manuscripts..." I have edited the Dharma-kośa- 
sangraha, a Sanskrit text from Nepal, which names the five

8
heavens as follows on p.21:
Vai rocana
Vajradhatu bhuvana
Ak sobhyaAbhirati bhuvana
RatnasambhavaRatnavati bhuvana
Amitabha
Sukhavati bhuvana
Amoghasiddhi
Amoghavati bhuvana
The San Hyan Nagabayusutra has Sahavati-lokadhatu for Vairocana, 
and Kusumi ta-lokadhatu for Amoghasiddha. The Kalpabuddha 
repeats them in slightly different expressions : Sahavati naran 
in kadatwani ra, and Kusumita naran in kaswargganira (Bosch 1929: 
131,132). This variation in the names of two paradises may be 
sought in the parallel carya-tantra tradition of Vairocana where 
he is surrounded by Ratnaketu in the east, Sanku sumita-raja in 
the south, Amitabha in the west, Divyadundubhi-megha-nirghosa 
in the north. Kusumita-lokadhatu may be connected with 
Sankusumita-raja (Lokesh Chandra 1972: pl.1-5, Tajima 1959:77). 
The whole question merits further investigation.
The Balinese San Hyan Nagabayu-sutra gives the krodha 
counterparts of the Five Tathagatas or their wrathful aspects. 
It is not appropriate to term them 'demoniac aspects' as done 
by Bosch. In the Balinese manuscript they are :
DirectionTathāgataKrodhaMyō-o(Jap. )=

EastAk şobhyaYamamararājaTrai lokyavi jaya
SouthRatnasambhavaSimhavahanaKundalT
WestAmitabhaMatthanaYamantaka

AmoghasiddhaVatsala
Vajrayakṣa
Bosch compares them with the Five Vidyaraja, Godai Myo-o in 
Japanese, who are of furious appeardee to destroy all sorts 
of evil spirits on the orders of Mahavai rocana (JEBD.1965; 
208a s.v. Myo-o). They have an angry visage and ferocious 
forms to combat demoniacal forces of evil, but are not

9
demoniacal themselves as contended by Bosch. The Five Vidyārājas 
have been contraposed here according to the direction 
corresponding to the Five Tathāgatas. Navabhava may mean 
'the Newly Arisen' Acala, Matthana can be a corruption of 
Ya-mantaka where Ya was misunderstood as the Oldjavanese ya 
'this', and Vatsala can be a reflection of vajra pronounced 
as vadzara. Bosch refers to the highly evolved and late Tibetan 
iconography of Yamantaka with 9 heads, 34 arms and 16 legs, 
who held fear-inspiring lugubrious attributes from the cemetery 
and he opines that "the appearance of vatsala and of the other 
vidyarajas cannot have differed much from that of Yamantaka" 
(p.118). Yamantaka did not have only this form. The forms of 
this deity showed wide divergences according to its Tantric 
division or subdivision. In the earlier tradition of the 
Maha-Vairocana-tantra as preserved in Japanese iconography (as 
well as in the text) Yamantaka has 6 heads, 6 arms and 6 legs 
(Lokesh Chandra 1972: pl.23). Here he holds no gruesome 
implements. He wields a scimitar, mace (gadā), trident and 
cakra while both his original hands are in the dharma-mudră. 
The Indonesian icons must have been closer to the Japanese forms 
which conform to the early Sanskrit texts. Besides, the traditions 
of both the countries belong to the same period of transmission 
from India in the middle of the eighth century. Vatsala need 
not be interpreted as an euphemism. The precise identification 
and interpretation of Buddhist Tantric iconography suffers from 
lack of exact correlation of the various iconic forms back to 
the relevant texts whence they arose. But, Kundala never rides 
a lion (sinha), as can be ascertained from Japanese iconographic 
texts. In the yoga-tantras Yamantaka, Kundall, Vajrayakṣa, and 
Acala are represented in the Trailokyavi jaya-karna-Mandala in 
peaceful aspects (Lokesh Chandra 1972: pl.785-788). In their 
angry appearances they are represented in the carya-tantras 
which are delineated in the Garbhadhātu-mandala. Here in the 
Quarter of Vidyadharas are shown Acala (SW), Vajrahünkara or

10
Trailokyavajra, Prajñāpāramita (centre), Yamantaka and 
Trailokyavi jaya (NW). The Balinese text may interpolate the 
carya-tantra tradition into the yoga-tantras, or represents 
a yoga-tantra school which has to be traced in the maze of 
Tibetan Tantric literature.
Next, Bosch (p.118-120) takes up the pari vara-devatas of 
the Five Tathāgatas as specified in the Balinese manuscripts of 
the San Hyan Nagabayusutra and Kalpabuddha. He refers to the 
San Hyan Kamahayanikan and to variations in its manuscripts 
A and B. This text needs a critical edition by collating all 
the manuscripts and by taking into account the new light on 
Tantric tradition of India, Nepal, Japan and Tibet. Bosch 
lamented the lacuna of comparable materials: "after having 
looked in vain in the Nepalese and Tibetan pantheons for anything 
comparable with the said vajra-deities" (p.119). All the deities 
are found in Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, but modern historians 
of art are reluctant to touch! the source-texts and the stalemate 
in further identifications or confirmation of previous 
identifications continues. The parivara-devatas of the Vajradhātu 
mandala are not only mentioned but their attributesspecified
at length in the Sanskrit texts found from Nepal: Ni spannayogavati 
of Abhayakaragupta (text p. 44-47), Dharma-kosa-sangraha (pp. 79-83), 
Kriyasangraha, Kriyasamuccaya, etc. All the pari vara-devatas are 
described in full details in Classical Tibetan texts and commentaries 
of the division of yoga-tantras (Kanjur: Toh. 479,480, Tanjur: 
Toh. 2501-2531) which are translations of Sanskrit originals. 
Texts 2504, 2516, and 2529 detail the liturgy and delineation 
of the mahamandala (rightly so termed) of Vajradhatu, of the 
Tathāgata family, with 1037 deities as enunciated in the first 
chapter of the mula-tantra Tattva-sangraha. This is illustrated 
in the New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, part 13 no.22. Prof. Tucci 
(1935:III/1.39ff) has described the mandala of Vairocana 
according to the Tattvasangraha at the Tabo monastery of the 
10-11th century, alongwith all the attendant deities.

11
Bosch compares the pantheon of the San Hyan Nagabayusūtra 
and Kalpabuddha with the Vajradhātu-mahamandala, the central 
mandala of the Japanese Vajradhatu (Jap. Kongōkai). The twin 
mandalas (Jap. genzu mandara) of Garbhadhatu and Vajradhātu 
were taken to Japan by Kōbō daishi in A.D.806. His master 
Hui-kuo had them drawn for him. Different transmissions were 
synthesised on two scrolls. The Japanese Vajradhatu mandala 
is not one mandala. It is a collection of nine mandalas : 
comprising 6 types of Vajradhatu mandalas, 1 Naya-mandala and 
2 types of Trailokyavi jaya mandalas. The three represent 
different subdivisions of the yoga-tantras. Within the yoga- 
tantras, there are two explanatory tantras from the upaya and 
prajna standpoints. The Vajradhātu mandalas represent the 
various steps of the path in the basic tantra Tattva-sahgraha. 
The naya-mandala represents the Naya-sutra which is explanatory 
from the prajña standpoint. The Trailokyavi jaya is explanatory 
from upaya view of the second section (vajra-kula) of the 
Tattva-sangraha (Wayman 1973:236). In Tibet they are separate 
mandalas. 
The most important among them is the central mandala 
which is rightly termed a dai mandara (=mahamandala) in the 
Japanese tradition, and is also known as the Jōjin-ne (kaya- 
mandala) and karma-mandala. Originally it was not the central 
part of a composite mandala, but it was the primary mandala of 
the yoga-tantras, with an independent existence of its own. In 
the Ni spannayogavall and also in the Tibetan tradition it has 
an entity of its own! Though Bosch had nearly arrived at a
the
correct conclusion regarding the Chandi Sewu being the 
Vajradhātu-Bahamandala, he was beset with doubts by the fact 
that the mahamandala was only "the central square of the mandala"," 
a part of the whole, and how could a part be an integrality of 
a gigantic monument that the Chandi Sewu is and was intended 
to be. Hence we have pointed out its sovereign existence as a 
separate entity of its basic tantra: the Tattvasangraha.

12
A few terminological corrections have to be effected in 
Bosch p.121: the so-called Sacrificing Taras should be changed 
to Puja-devis, the Commanding Taras to Sangraha-Taras.
Bosch is perfectly right in saying that Vajradhātu deities 
embody themselves in the Sewu complex. Though its niches have 
been spoiled of their invaluable bronzes, the entire plan is a 
confirmation. The central temple enshrined Vairocana, while 
the four surrounding cellas housed the other four Tathagatas 
Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amoghasiddha and their 
niches the pari vara-devatas of each of the five Tathāgatas. The 
east cella of Aksobhya was the antechamber whence the devotee 
entered the constellation of winding structures on his 
circumambulation (pradaksina). In the central temple there are 
arrangements for 24 deities instead of 25 as required by the 
text. Bosch proposes that the prajña (consort) of Vairocana, 
Sattvavajri (Vajradevi, Vajrasattvātmikā, or VajradhātvisvarT) 
was fused with the consort of Aksobhya: Vajradhatvisvar the 
consort of Vairocana and Locana the consort of Aksobhya are one 
quintessentially (San Hyan Kamahayanikan p.115). Thus the 37 
deities of the Vajradhātu mandala were represented as follows: 
24 Five Tathāgatas with their attendant deities
4 pūjā-devis at the four corners of the building s
8 puja-and sangraha-devis in the medium chapel (remains of 
five have been laid bare)
36
The four rows of 240 subsidiary chapels housed the Thousand 
Buddhas. Each of these chapels housed 4 of the Thousand Buddhas, 
thus giving a total of 240 x 4 = 960 Buddhas. It suited the 
architectural requirements of every chapel that one of the 
Thousand Buddhas be placed in the centre and three others in 
the niches in the three walls, while the fourth side being 
the entrance-portal was empty. Bosch surmises that thousand 
means 'very many and 240 could suffice for a Thousand Buddhas 
of the Bhadrakalpa, "the founder of the complex erected 
'merely' 240 sanctuaries for harbouring the Buddhas of the

13
Bhadrakalpa". This surmise is unnecessary. In our scheme,
240 chapels enshrined 960 Buddhas. The total of 1000 was made up as 
follows:
36 deities in the central temple
4 deities of Elements in the corners as in the Japanese 
Mahamandala
960 Thousand Buddhas 
1000
In the Japanese mahamandala the four deities of the Elements, 
namely, Teja, Apaḥ, Vayu and Prtavi are situated in the four 
corners (Lokesh Chandra 1972: pl.464-467). These statues must 
have been placed in the corners of the enceinte under the open 
sky, or vestiges of lost chapels may be exhumed in future 
excavations. The expression Chandi Sewu can thus go back to 
ancient times, even to the eighth century (Fontein et al 1971: 
144 no.4) when the visualisation and construction of the 
gigantic ensemble took place. Thus the founder of the Sewu 
complex was conscious and financially capable of constructing 
a mandala of precisely one thousand deities. The apprehension 
of Bosch about "remaining within the bounds of his material 
resources" (p.130) cannot hold good.
The patron of the Sewu mahamandala must have been a king 
of the Sailendra dynasty who dedicated this ensemble to 
Vairocana as the Cakravartin, that is, "Universal Monarch". 
In Japan, Vairocana in his form as Daini chi-kinrin 'Vai ro cana 
Cakravarti is depicted mounted on a lion and enclosed within 
cakra? 
aIn the Kalpabuddha (Bosch p.132) too Vairocana's 
weapon is cakra (cakra sanjata nira) and he rides a lion 
(singh atutunganani ra). Cakra is the prime symbol of the 
universal dominion of a cakravartin, and the lion the emblem 
of his unchallenged prowess. In Japan most of the iconographic 
manuals have the cakravarti-mandala of Vairocana where he is 
surrounded by the sapta-ratna or seven constituents of the 
state: queen, minister, commander-in-chief, horse, elephant, 
cintamani jewel and cakra. For example, in the 12th century

of the rituals of Cakravarti-Vai rocana in Japanese texts like the 
Asabasho will help to clarify the function of the Vai ro cana- 
mahamandala and its importance in the history of Classical 
Indonesia.
We have historic evidence of the eighth century that 
Vairocana did symbolise empirium. In Japan, emperor Shomu issued 
a rescript in A.D.743 ordering the construction of the gigantic 
statue (daibutsu) of Vairocana, 16 metres in height, at the 
Todai ji monastery in his attempt to unify the nation in an 
awareness of its power, as an 'apt symbol of the emperor as the 
controlling head of the state' (Kobayashi 1975:22), as 
especially valuable political and religious symbol' (Kobayashi 
1975:25) to consolidate the sovereignty of the nation in a 
harmony of the emperor and his people on the deeper spiritual 
levels of a shared awareness: it was a 'Grand National Temple'. 
When the old capital at Nara was abandoned and a new capital 
was established at Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) in A.D.794, the 
Toji temple was an integral part of the metropolitan masterplan. 
It was "intended to invoke the protection of the divinities 
and thereby to assure the peace and prosperity" (Sawa 1972:130) 
of the kingdom. It was placed in charge of Kobo daishi himself, 
the great master who introduced Shingon Buddhism with its 
central deity of Vairocana. The temple was significantly termed 
Kyō-o-gokoku-ji temple for the protection of the state', which 
popularly came to be known as the Tōji (to-east, jintemple) as 
city 
it was built on the east side of the gate. The temples of 
Vairocana seem to have gained national dimensions as means of 
preempting threat to the security of the nation and securing
A

15
protection of the head of the state. The Chandi Sewu demanding 
enormous resources must have been envisaged by a mighty king of 
the Sailendras for the peace and security of his person and of 
his realm, in an ever-continuing process of stabilisation of 
his dynasty. The continuity of the terrestrial mandala or realm 
was affirmed in being consecrated by an eternal mahamandala or 
cosmogram of Vairocana: mandalarthe mahamandalam as we may put 
it in Sanskrit. The inscribed stone of A.D.792 found in the 
ruins of Sewu may have to be reconsidered in a new light.
THE NANJUK BRONZES
Ever since their discovery in 1913 from desa Chandi Reja 
near Nañjuk (Kediri, East Java), these 90 bronzes have been 
the subject of study. Krom (1913:59ff.) studied 40 of them 
and at once came to the conclusion that they constituted a

seen clearly in "minor details of importance". Kempers

(1959:63-64 pl.168-171) added no new identifications, 
reproduced exquisite pictures of Gita, Dhupa, Puspa and 
Vajratiksna. So far the principal image of the group with 
four faces defied identification. Krom (p.64) felt that it
does not represent Vai rocana but a special hypostasis of 
Mañjusri. The Dutch scholars had compared the group only with 
Japanese iconography which shuns multifaced deities in favour 
of one-faced anthropomorphy.
The Chinese and following them the Japanese chose the 
one-faced, two-armed Vairo cana from the Vajra-sekhara-tantra.

of Indonesian art or newer directions in the classical 
archaeology of Indonesia.
Alongwith the
The foregoing survey leads us to two conslusions:
(1) The dominant form of Buddhism prevalent in Indonesia was 
the yoga-tantra whose basic scriptures were the Tattvasangraha 
and its explanatory Vajrasekhara-tantra. (11) Both these 
texts and their ancillary exegetical tradition were also in

17
high vogue in India, particularly, in the south of India, around 
Kanchi, whence yoga-tantra Buddhism was carried to East Asia 
as well as Indonesia. Kanchipura was a great seaport of India, 
as stated by Hsuan-tsang (Walters 1905:1.227). It was from here 
that Vajrabodhi the son of the royal preceptor of the Pallavas 
whose capital was at Kanchi, travelled to China in 719 on board 
a Persian merchant vessel. He had taken with him the Vajrasekhara- 
tantra which was lost in the confusion of the fatal storm on 
the high seas, in which 29 ships out of 30 were lost. Only an 
abridged version of the Vajrasekhara survived, which Vajrabodhi 
translated into Chinese later. The yoga-tantras must have played 
quite a role in South India. It would not be strange, if the 
Borobudur were a major mandala of this denomination. It is no 
coincidence that the Nagarakṛtāgama 77.3 by Prapanca (A.D.1365) 
enumerates the Budur as one of the important sanctums of the 
vajradhara Buddhists (kasugatan kabajradharan) which was 
registered in the state archives (Pigeaud 1960:1.59 text, 3.89 
transl.). It is noteworthy that Budur is without the prefix 
bara.
On the basis of the Nagarakṛtāgama, and the actual discovery 
of vajras on small sheets of gold, Bosch had clearly surmised, 
as early as 1920, that the Borobudur pertained to the Vajradhara 
sect (NBG.1920:52ff., TBG.67/1929:173 ff.). This was confirmed 
by W.F. Stutterheim (1956:14) who repeated in 1929 that the 
Borobudur "must have belonged" to this sect. In the 1920s and. 
even up to our day it was not possible to correlate the 
Vajradharas with a specific Tantric system, and much less so 
the architectural manifestation of their philosophical expression. 
The Vajradhara Buddhists were those who followed the yoga-tantras; 
their Lord was Vajradhara, while the Lord of the anuttara-yoga 
tantras was Mahavajradhara, who emanates all the deities in the 
Guhyasamaja-tantra (Vayman 1977:124). The distinction is 
relevant to the precise understanding of the Nagarakṛtāgama 
which is using 'vajradhara' as a specialised technical term.

18
a
As indicated by the Nagarakṛtāgama, Budur was the main 
element of the compound Bara Budur. So bara should have 
generic connotation of a sanctum. Already the possibility of 
bara being derived from vihara via Malay biyara was mooted by 
The 
Poerbatjaraka and Stutterheim (Moens 1951:332ff.). 
linguistic difficulties inherent in the transition from biyara 
to bara have always stood in the way of its universal acceptance. 
But, alongwith the word vihara there was the collateral form 
vahara which may be a mongerel term or an intentional change 
(vahara from avahara, like agrahara 'a religious endowment') 
to distinguish a tantric Buddhist monastic establishment from 
a usual Buddhist monastery. The use of vahara (pronounced 
bahara) is attested in the famous Naw-bahar, the renowned 
Buddhist monastery at Balkh which was visited by the Chinese 
pilgrim Hsuan-tsang in the seventh century, and was damaged by 
"The term 
the Arabs in A.D. 663-4 (EI.1960:1.1001 s.v. Balkh). 
Naw-bahār, moreover, likewise derives from Sanskrit nava vihara 
'new monastery'. Some 1500 sq. km. of lands were attached to it, 
and it was the centre of national resistance when attacked by 
Muawiya about A.D.663-4" (EI.1960:1.1033a,s.v.al-Baramika 
Al Barmak). Later authors like Yakut 4.819 and Ibn Khallikān 
3.198 make it a Zoroastrian fire-temple, which can well be a 
mi sunderstanding, but also an indication that homa may have 
been conducted here as a part of tantric worship.
or
Vajrayana was prevalent in Central Asia as is attested by 
vajrayana texts in the Iranian-speaking domains of Khotan, like 
the Adhyardhaśatika prajñāpāramita (Bailey 1965: 27-39, Williams 
1973:116-117) which is positively a text of the yoga-tantric 
system. The copy of the Khotanese Jatakastava was written for 
Ca Kima-sani ambassador of the Khotanese kings Visa süra (967-977) 
and Visa Darma (978-982) to increase the merit of householders 
of vajrayana. A bilingual Sanskrit-Khotanese scroll records a 
conversation between a person from Tun-huang and a Khotanese

19
resident asks "which book do you like". The bhiksu from Khotan 
replies: "I like vajrayana" (Bailey 1938:529, Williams 1973:117). 
Khotan played a leading role in disseminating Avatamsaka to China 
and the iconographic type of Vairocana in Khotanese and Chinese 
art corresponds to the Avatamsaka-sutra (Williams 1973:120).
The name of the Sogdian town of Bokhara (also spelt Bukhara) 
is derived from the Sanskrit vihara (EI.1960: 1.1293), which is 
made doubly probable by the discovery of a vihara near Numidikath, 
the predecessor town of Bukhara (Frye 1956: 106ff). The 
pronunciation Bokhara with o is a dialectical variation in which 
survives the ancient vahāra. The form Bokhara is attested in 
c.1666 as 'Bokara prunes' (Bernier, ed. Constable. 118, Yule/ 
Burnell 1903:16.s.v. Aloo Bokhara). In India, the Persian 
alu-bokhara has bo, which should be the classical pronunciation 
of Iran, with its ancestry going back to times prior to the 
Runic Turkish (8th cent.) Uigur and Mongolian bugar. The 
Sogdian form, which we should expect at Bokhara, was varḥār. 
Paul Pelliot (1959:1.108 s.v. Bucara) is uncertain about the 
derivation of varhar from vihara. It may go back to a 
hypothetic varahara 'the splendid (vara) monastic endowment 
(hara), on the analogy of Sanskrit agrahara royal donation of 
land to Brahmans; land or village thus given, MBh. '(MW).
In the earliest Western document of 1221, the name occurs 
as Bachara (Pelliot 1959:108). The lost colloquial Indic from 
vahara developed into bahar and bokhar, a being pronounced as 
0. Pelliot's discussion about the etymology of Bokhara does 
not take into account the possibility of the Indic from vahāra, 
which is enhanced by the Newari term vahal for the Buddhist 
temples of vajrayana in Nepal. The Indonesian bara, pronounced 
in Modern Javanese as boro, can be traced back to bahara < 
ba'ara (by the elision of h)< bara (coalescence of the two a)< 
bara (influenced by vara 'excellent, supreme'). In modern 
Tamil, his a glide for hiatus, Murahari for Mura-ari (Murari). 
Conversely the h in bahara was considered an epenthetic and

20
dropped. Compare the modern Balinese Mendra for Mahendra. 
"The most famous Naubi har was the one at Balkh which 
Hsuan-tsang, c.630, calls Nava-sang harama, New Monastery, but 
there were a number of other Nav-bi har in Sind, at Samarkand, 
at Bokhara, and even at Ray (east of Tehran). I must confess 
that I do not see why we have only "New" monasteries in Iran 
(Pelliot 1959 108). The 'New' Monasteries should have belonged 
to Tantric Buddhism which was the 'New' Way in contradistinction 
to Theravada and Mahayana. Bokhara is mentioned in Chinese 
texts in the 5th century as Niu-mi, transcription of its ancient 
name Numi j. Its first mention as Buqaraq (with the ancient 
Iranian final -k) is in the 8th century Runic Turkish inscriptions 
of Orkhon, by which time Tantric Buddhism should have become 
prevalent and might even have supplanted other schools. 
Amoghavajra (705-774) who translated yoga-tantra texts into 
Chinese may have been helped by Hui-lin from Kashgar. Besides, 
he mentions five disciples from Samarkand (K'ang), Tashkent 
(Shih), Tukhara (Lo), Betik (Pi) in his Memorial of A.D.767. 
In another Memorial dated A.D.768 he requested permission to 
tonsure three disciples from Tukhara, and Ishtikhan (Chou 1945: 
329-330). The great Chinese Tantric Master, Hui-kuo (746-805) 
the guru of Kōbō Dai shi, had Pien-hung of Java as his disciple. 
Subhakarasimha (637-735), who was the first great master of 
vajrayana in China, has bequeathed to us the Rita-sangara-gobu- 
shingan (Jap. pronunciation) which illustrates six mandalas of 
Rta-samhara or Tattvas ang raha. The drawings were done by his 
Central Asian, more precisely, Irani an-speaking, disciple as is 
evident from the Sassanoid coronets of the deities and from the
colophon acarya-sri-Saubh[ik] asya suratah (Lokesh Chandra 1965: 
(50) where suratah is the Iranian word surat 'picture'. The
presence of vajrayana in Central Asia in its form of yoga-tantra 
is the denomination to which the 'new' monasteries should have 
belonged.

21
Central Asia has preserved a distinction between earlier 
monasteries with their austere statutary and ascetic discipline 
and the new tantric monasteries in their splendour of ritual 
and graceful images of gods 'eternally young' and of charming 
goddesses.
Biruni (Athar al-baqiya, ed. E. Sachau p.206) considers 
behar and faryar synonymous, but Al-Khwarizmi (Mafatih al-'u'lum 
p.123) clearly distinguishes them semantically: "buhar is the 
idol temple of India and faryar is the idol-temple of China 
and Upper Sughd or Sogdiana" (Frye 1956: 115 n.52). Al-Khwarizmi 
in all probability preserves a distinction in the denominational 
context of the two terms which though confused later on were 
once contradistinctive: faryar must have denoted the usual, that 
is non-tantric, monastery and behar must have been a monastic 
centre dedicated to the new Tantric system, with the daily homa 
ceremonies and the vast pantheon of Tantric gods and goddesses 
giving it a distinctive character. The homa, a regular feature 
of Tantric Buddhism, is still performed early every morning in 
some Shingon monasteries which continue the traditions of the 
tantras introduced in Japan in A.D.806. The homa ceremonies 
must have been responsible for confusing the Nawbahar with a 
Fire Temple (Yakut 4.819, Ibn Khallikan 3.198, E.I.1.1033). 
The grace and charm of the many Buddhist images, particularly 
of the enchanting Tantric goddesses in all their concupiscence 
must have given the equation "ideal beauty-Buddhist image", 
which was an established fact in the East Iranian world, Even 
when Buddhism had faded away, early Persian poetry continued to 
cultivate abstract mental forms poignantly recalling ideals of 
the grace of Buddhist statues. Ayyuqi in his novel entitled 
Varge va Golshah (Tehran 1956:6 ) writes of his beautiful 
heroine that "she was a Buddha in a temple full of offerings." 
Further on we find the crescendo in stanzas 2138-2142 where she 
is addressed as Bot (Buddha), then lo 'bat (statuette), and 
finally as nowbahar, the Buddhist monastery which was well known

22
for its graceful statues in Iranian literature (both in the 
Persian and Arabic languages) upto the time of Yaqut in the 
13th century. In early Persian poetry, Young beauty whether 
masculine or feminine, is constantly referred to by the poet 
or addressed by various characters in their romance as Bot 
(Buddha). Early Persian literature as we know it, is a creation 
of the Eastern Iranians and till the 11th century Persian poetry 
was exclusively written in Khorasan, Sogdiana and adjacent lands 
The Buddhist overtones of

Persian poetical vocabulary were memories of a time when the 
images were loaded with their full emotional and aesthetic 
import. No wonder that the metaphor of the Bot is the term that 
the description of beauty spontaneously calls for.

The syndrome of literary, linguistic, and archaeological 
evidence from Indonesia itself makes it evident that yoga- 
tantric Buddhism was prevalent during sailendra rule in Java

23
in the 8th and early 9th century.
A prominent aspect of
this type of Buddhism was the representation of mandalas in 
various media, culminating in their most impressive magnificence

of Mendut-Pawon-Borobudur could have been no exception. 
Scholars have rightly found it perplexing to consider the 
Borobudur as a stupa (Fontein 1971:21). It was the brilliant 
exposée of Paul Mus and others that lent an air of certainty to 
the interpretation of Borobudur as a stupa, and that so 
overshadowed subsequent discussions that another possibility was. 
precluded. Occasional expressions of the mandala-like plan of 
the Borobudur were mooted but they faded out in the absence of 
'architectural mandalas'.
Moens (1951:335,341) had explicitly compared the Borobudur 
with the Mongolian khoto-mandal 'city mandala', but missed to 
recognise its implications as an architectonic mandala, with 
the precise identification of every detail. This could not be 
done unless we had a comprehensive, or at least a representative, 
collection of mandalas. The mandalas had not been studied in 
the West except that a few were known as aesthetic glamours. 
An appropriate understanding of the mandalas as coherent 
cosmograms incorporating a system of thought in art, as visual 
dharma, had not yet dawned. Even today the complex integrality 
of each and every element of the mandalas based on their 
original sources in specific tantric texts has yet to be 
discovered as a scientific fact to become a part of academic 
consciousness. In the year 1967, the writer brought out for 
the first time the line drawings of the most comprehensive 
series of 132 mandalas of all the classes of tantras, as parts 
13,14,15 of A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon. They stem from Tibet, 
but they incorporate all the known Classical traditions of 
Sanskrit tantras in their diverse variations.
Detailed investigations in the direction of defining the 
Borobudur as a mandala were suppressed by the stunning logic

24
of Mus who could find nothing specially Tantric about it: 
"Le Barabudur n'est pas spécialement tantrique. S'il l'est ce 
n'est qu'avec tout le Mahayani sme" (Moens 1951:336). As late as 
1971, Jan Fontein 1971:37 reinforced the same view with greater 
emphasis: "The doctrinal contents of the sutras which were 
chosen to be illustrated on the walls of the Borobudur suggest 
that Sailendra Buddhism was a relatively pure type of Mahāyāna 
without many Tantric accretions." So far the Borobudur has 
seemed to present no single text but an eclectic conglomeration 
of the representation of scenes from varied originals ranging 
from the Karmavi bhanga, Jātakas and Lalitavistara to the 
Gandavyuha of the Avatamsaka-sutras. They fall into a logical
sequence, but there is a lurking feeling that they lack the 
authority of a classical pattern, or the sanction of a precedent 
in tradition, in their totality. The overall impression persists 
that the Borobudur was the creation of an ingenious mind 
coordinating divergent elements in a brilliant manner, meditating 
in the beauties of Mount Menoreh as the Indonesian legend has 
it.
It would help to elucidate the precise character of the 
Borobudur and to identify it as a mandala, and that too a 
specific one, if we consider some architectural mandalas to 
affirm the concept of pura-mandala and if we correlate the 
textual descriptions to their actual representation as monuments. 
Now let us refer to some yoga-tantric monastic centres like 
Tabo, Alchi, and Gyantse Kumbum,
The Tattva-sangraha (Toh.479) was translated by 
śraddhakaravarman and Rin-chen-bzan-po (c.958-1055). The 
Tattva-sangraha embodies the mandala of Sarvavid Vairocana. 
Rin-chen-bzań-po founded monasteries at Tabo and Alchi to 
introduce the new mandalas of this system. The Tabo (Tib.Ta- 
pho) monastery is situated on the north bank of the Spiti 
river in Himachal Pradesh. It was enlarged and repaired by 
king Byan-chub-hod. Life size stucco images of the deities

25
of the Vajradhātu-mandala are set around the walls in a 
rectangular arrangement. This temple is a "complete three- 
dimensional mandala" (Snellgrove 1957:185,66-67) and none other 
of such antiquity survives. The layout of the 33 deities can 
be seen in G. Tucci's Indo-Tibetica (1935:3/1.26 fig.2). It is 
unusual in being unlike the circular arrangement described in 
the texts (diagram in Tucci 1935:3/1.60) and found in Tibetan 
scrolls and also in Japanese paintings. The central image of 
Vairocana is four-faced with the two hands in samadhi-mudrā 
(Tucci 1935:3/1.32). Beneath the images, along the left wall, 
there are frescoes narrating the story of Nor-bzan or Sudhana. 
On the right wall is the life of Sakyamuni to represent the 
journey of the bodhisattva to the perfection of buddhahood 
(Snellgrove 1957:188).
Besides the central temple (Gtsug-lag-khan), Tabo has 
seven other temples, with Byams-paḥi lha-khan = Maitreya-
devalaya, a temple dedicated to Maitreya. It is situated 
alongside the main temple on the northern direction.The image
7
of Maitreya is pralamba-pada with his legs hanging down. There 
are a number of stupas in the Tabo complex. In the earlier 
form of the Mahakaruṇa-garbha mandala of Vairo cana, based on 
the Mahavai ro canabhi sambodhi-tantra of the kriya-tantra division, 
Maitreya and Avalokitesvara are found in the central lotus 
(Tajima 1959:66).
The Gsum-tshag temple in the Alchi village in Lower Ladakh 
houses a gigantic image of Vai rocana. It was erected by King 
Byan-chub-sems-dpaḥ in about 1020-50 (Peter 2/2.7) during the 
life of Rin-chen-bzan-po. It has a large number of mandalas in 
frescoes. The Vairocana is four-faced, two-armed, in bodhyagri 
mudra, hiscolor is white, his symbol: 5-pointed vajra, his 
vahana: lion (Lim 1964:336). It is an indication that as soon 
as a tantra was translated and came into vogue its representation 
as a mandala followed the text immediately.
In the early 15th century the most important of Buddhist

706 chapels containing both sculptures and murals, with 108 
doors. "The basic construction is that of a gigantic mandala 
(Karmay 1975:27, 34n.130). It was completed and consecrated 
in 1427 by the prince of Rgyal-rtse, Chos-rgyal Rab-brtan-kun- 
bzan-hphags-pa (1389-1442). This is renowned as the Gyantse 
Kumbum and it integrates the majority of mandalas of the 
different tantras. Different media are employed in making 
mandalas with coloured powders on floors, painting them on 
o nvasses, or some are built into pavillions where the symbols 
a fitting 
and the images bulge out of the background in 
arrangement: those architectonic mandalas are called lölang 
blo-lans (Tucci 1956:37). The Gyantse Kumbum is a vast 
architectonic mandala comprising in its unique pantheonic sweep 
the multiplicity of mandalas. Its architectural composition 
is five stories of buildings superimposed by a cupola and three- 
storied campana. These nine stories (Wen-wu 1961:1.53) conform 
to the pattern of the depiction of Mount Sumeru in Tibetan 
thanka scrolls (Wayman 1973:101ff)? The first five stories are 
the five terraces of the Sumeru mountain. In the worship of a 
mandala, the first step is evocation of the Sumeru, which is 
adharotpatti or generation of the residence, for the adheya 
or the deity which is invoked to take its residence there. A 
three-storied eaved palace rests in the clouds atop Sumeru 
(Wayman 1973:108). This is the kūṭāgāra of the Sanskrit and 
Tibetan texts, and the three-storied campana of the Gyantse 
the 
Kumbum, which is specially notable for its adherence to 
injunctions of the Classical tantric texts in minute details 
of architectural form. For instance, the Ni spannayogavall of 
Abhayakara-gupta which is a fundamental text for the construction 
of mandalas, makes it clear that mandalas were situated in a 
kūṭāgāra or pavilion atop the Sumeru mountain, with the main 
deity in the centre and others in their appropriate placements 
(p.8,26,42 sumeru pari, sumeru-murdhni 'on the summit of Sumera').

27
The mandala pervaded the entire spiritual life of yoga- 
tantric Buddhism, to such an extent that even the cham dances 
of the Lamaist world reflect in minute details the iconography 
of a mandala. René de Nebesky Wojkowitz (1976:88), in his 
translation of the Tibetan dance-manual (tshan-yig) of Vajrakтla, 
says: "The dancers express with their movement nothing else 
than the iconographic details of Vajrakila's mandala."
The Chandi Mendut
The Chandi Mendut was constructed by the Sailendra king 
Indra (782-812). The Inscription of Karangtěnah (Casparis 
1950:39) dated 824, names it as Venuvana: venuvanabhi khyam... 
jinamandi ram in line 21. According to Casparis (p.204) it is 
"one complex whole with Pawon and Borobudur", and "chronologically 
speaking, it is the oldest of the three". He further states: 
"when Indra built the Venuvana, he realised that he belonged 
to the Family of the Tathagata, identified with the Cailendra 
ancestors. This interpretation, might explain why just nine 
Bodhisattvas were sculptured on the outside of Tjandi Mendut."
King Indra himself has provided a key to the identification 
of the Mendut by using the expression 'Tathāgata-kula'. It is 
a technical term of the carya-tantras which are classified into 
three families (kula): Tathāgata-kula, padma-kula, and vajra- 
kula (Wayman 1973:237). The Tathāgata-kula has two tantras, 
namely, the Mahavai ro canabhi sambodhi-tantra and the Acala-kalpa 
(Toh.494, comm. Toh.2662-9). The Mahavai rocanabhi sambodhi- 
tantra is the source of the Garbhadhatu mandala, which has been 
known to Europe an scholars in its Japanese version since the 
last century. The identification of the Mendut with the 
Garbhadhātu mandala never occured to anyone because the San 
Hyan Kamahayanikan was utilised to identify (Kempers p.40) the 
three central statues as: Sakyamuni flanked by Lokesvara and 
Vajrapani. This text was insufficient to cover the system of 
Mendut. Moreover its text still awaits a critical edition and

28
the separation of various strata that constitute this compilation 
from varied sources.
The identification of the central deity in the temple 
vacillated (and rightly so) between Sakyamuni and Vairocana. 
Kempers (1959:40) himself was conscious that "it is not the 
'human Buddha' Sakyamuni who is meant". Though he came very 
close: "The first is known in Buddhist iconography as Garbhadhātu, 
the second as Vajradhātu. This system or variety of systems 
was also known in Central Java", but he was under the impression 
that "several systems of Buddhist mythology and cosmology" 
overlapped. This was inevitable in the absence of a precise 
knowledge that the placement of the statues of deities inside 
and the reliefs on the walls outside corresponds to a mandala. 
The use of the term Tathāgata-kula was hardly ever appreciated 
which makes it certain that the Mendut belongs to this family 
which is symbolised by the Garbhadhatu mandala.
In the Japanese graphic representation, the Garbhadhātu 
mandala can be divided into three main enceintes: the first or 
inner enceinte, the second or middle enceinte and the third or 
outer enceinte. The inner enceinte comprises four quarters of 
1. Universal Knowledge, 2. Vidyadharas (with Prajñāpāramita in 
the centre), 3. Avalokitesvara and 4. Vajrapāņi. The second 
enceinte has six quarters of 5. Sakyamuni, 6. Mañjuśrī,
7. Kṣitigarbha, 8. Sarva-nivarana-vi skambhin, 9-10. Akāśagarbha 
and the allied Susiddhi. The outer quarter of vajras has Hindu 
deities.
The Mendut temple has :
1. the Five Tathāgatas inside the cella: Vairocana flanked by 
Avalokitesvara and Vajrapani. The remaining four Tathāgatas 
once occupied the niches which are empty today.
On the four walls out side we find :
2. Eight bodhisattvas in the corners.
3. Prajñāpāramita in the large central panel on the right wall. 
4. Akabagarbha/Khagarbha on the large central panel on the left
wall.

29
5. Lokesvara on the back wall.
The arrangement of the Mendut corresponds to the Japanese 
mandala as follows:

Mahavai ro cana at Mendut is in the dharma cakra mudra. So
also in the Durgati-pari sodhana-mandala: śri-Sakyasimho bhagavan

text 66). The bronze image of Vairocana and Vajradhātvi svarī 
Asin the Leiden Museum (no.2862) has the dharma cakra mudra. 
we have already pointed out, Casparis considers the Mendut to 
be earlier than the Borobudur, as against the undefined view of 
Kempers (1959:37 pl.46-61) who says that "Mendut may date from 
about the same time as Barabudur, i.e. about A.D.800". The 
Mendut should have been constructed earlier than the Borobudur. 
The Mendut represents the Garbhadhātu mandala and the Borobudur 
the Vajradhatu mandala. The Garbhadhatu mandala leads to the 
Vajradhātu. The Garbhadhātu represents the carya-tantras whi ch 
later on developed into the yoga-tantras. As the carya-tantras 
lead to the yoga-tantras, so does Mendut lead to the Borobudur, 
and its construction is expected to have preceded:

30

Garbhadhatu mandala-Vajradhatu mandala
The Twin Mandalas of Garbhadhatu and Vajradhatu are known 
in Japanese as ryōbu mandara that is, the mandalas of both (ryo) 
the divisions (bu) of the carya and yoga tantras. They had been 
transmitted to Japan from Kanchi. It is most likely that the 
Twin Mandalas were prevalent in South India and they were a

likelihood the vajrayana of the Sailendras was derived from 
Southern India. There are a number of traces in the Sailendra 
monuments which stem from Tamil nuances of phonetics and

inscription bears the words: tiruranu (Casparis 1950:115). 
Casparis considers it to be the designation of an official. 
Tamil tiru is sri and ranu corresponds to Tamil ranuvam 'army' 
(Tamil Lexicon 6.3423). It refer to king Samaratunga, who 
may 
reigned 812-832 (Casparis 1950:201). It could have been his 
pet family name (tiru-śri, ranuva samara). The small bronze 
from Chandi Sewu reveals a definite affinity with the main 
image in the cella of Chandi Mendut (Fontein 1971:150 no.34). 
It clearly points to a close relationship between Sewu and 
Mendut temples.
The Inscription of Sri Kahulunnan dated saka 764 = A.D.842, 
which is correlated to the Borobudur by Casparis, begins with 
the date and the day is canai scarawara (Casparis 1950:86), 
instead of sa. Ca in place of sa is a common phenomenon in 
Tamil, where sani is cani.
A highly significant phrase occurs in the beginning of 
the two inscriptions:
line 4
sima nin kamulan i bhumi sambhara
II lines 2,3
sima nin kamulan <i bhumi> sambhara

31
Casparis interprets this expression on the assumption that 
Sailendra Buddhism was "orthodox" Mahayana, "corresponding
to the later treatises ascribed to Maitreya-natha-Asanga, viz. 
the Mahayanasutralankara, Abhi samayalankara, and Uttaratantra. 
It should not be called Tantric, as several of the main 
characteristics of Tantric Buddhism do not appear in the 
Çailendra documents" (p.202). Hence his interpretation of the 
expression is: "the exact meaning of the term kamulan by which 
the sanctuary is indicated. Compari son of some loci in Old- 
Javanese inscriptions suggests that kamulan refers to a building 
symbolizing the origin of a royal dynasty. If we remember that 
the name of the Çailendra dynasty means "Lord of the Mountain", 
it is possible to distinguish a clear thread connecting the 
dynasty with the great monument (p.202-3). Its "hidden meaning " 
implies a representation of the preceding Çailendra princes, 
each in their proper place on the road leading to Buddha-hood, 
the first ancestor, the "root" (mula) of the dynasty, the 
Çailendra, "Lord of the Mountain", at the final momentary 
meditation before obtaining Buddha-hood" (p.204). "The name of 
that sanctuary shows that it must refer to a Buddhistic building, 
representing the "Accumulation of the elements of Virtue on 
the ten Stages of the Bodhisattva". There cannot be any doubt 
that this sanctuary should be identified with Tjandi Barabudur. 
Next paragraph shows that according to phonological development 
of the Javanese language the present name is derived from the 
one mentioned in the inscription of 842, only the name given 
there is not complete: the full name of the sanctuary must have 
been Bhumi sambharabhudhara, "the Mountain of Accumulation of 
Virtue on the ten Stages of the Bodhisattva." (p.202).
Casparis has rightly come to the conclusion that the phrase 
refers to the Borobudur complex, on the analysis of the village 
names occurring in the inscription. But his interpretation 
of the word kamulan has to be viewed in a new light. Kamulan 
is a homonymic counterpart of mula-sthana where ka-... -a

32
denote sthāna.In Tamil this word occurs as mula-t-tānam
(from mula-sthana) 'sanctum sanctorum of a temple' (Tamil 
Lexicon). Tiru-mulattanam (tirus srl + mulasthana) refers 
to the sacred shrine of Tiruvarur (Tamil Lexicon, p.1913). The 
renowned North Indian geographic name Multan, which is derived 
from Sanskrit Mulasthana, also means 'The City of the7 Temple'. 
In Srilanka too, mula = arama (Encyclopaedia of Buddhism 3.22,24). 
Kamulan refers only to the sacred complex and has nothing to do 
with the origins of the Sailendra dynasty.
The compound bhumi sambhara is a proper name, a toponym. 
It means the 'land/country of the sambhara'. With it we may 
compare the geographic name Bumi -ayu (Fontein 1971: 149 no.30) 
in Brebes, Central Java, whence a bronze of seated Tara has 
been discovered with a Sanskrit inscription. It may be noted 
that the vowel length in the two inscriptions varies-- sambhara 
and sambhara. In Tamil sambara refers to the Buddhist community. 
Sambara is samvara meaning 'the Buddhist vows'. The transition 
from sambara to sambhara was an orthographic variation where

have been influenced by the Buddhist term sambhara (punya- 
sambhara, etc. in the Dharmasangraha (117). Thus bhumi sambhara
meant the land of the sambhara i.e. Indian Buddhists. The whole 
expression kamulan 1 bhumi sambhara means 'a monastic foundation 
of Indian Buddhists'. It is pertinent to cite the lead-bronze 
inscription discovered on the plain west of the Borobudur, which 
refers to a locus on a hill of the southern region (daksinapathasya 
parvvatasthale). Boe chari (Preliminary report on some 
archaeological finds around the Borobudur temple, cyclostyled 
paper 1976, p. 11) poses the question "Does this text refer to 
the Borobudur?" We feel that it does. Dakṣinapatha in Sanskrit 
is South India: the same as bhumi sambhara; parvatasthala 
refers to the Borobudur, the replica of Mount Sumeru. The 
Borobudur is in the village Bumi segoro (Skt. sagara-bhūmi) 
which alludes to it as the settlement of people beyond the

33
seas, i.e. India. In stanza 8 of the Kalasan Inscription of 
Saka 700 (Sarkar 1972:1.36, Casparis 1950:186) the sailendras 
do term themselves arya-santati. As late as the 11th century, 
Sailendras had intimate relations with South India: they founded 
a vihara at Nagapattinam, to which the Chola King granted the 
income of a village for support (Fontein 1971:33). We are led 
to the conclusion that Mendut-Pawon-Borobudur was modelled after 
the Indic tradition. Explicit specification of this fact 
emphasises the sanctity of the monastic complex and hints that 
the introduction of vajrayana in Indonesia was relatively recent.
FORM OF THE BOROBUDUR
The Borobudur was a vihara: it is attested by the 
Inscription of Karangtěnah of A.D.824 (line 15: astam vihāraḥ, 
Casparis 1950:40). The presence of the vihara has been proved 
by archaeological excavations. Its remains were found to the 
NW. of the monument (Kempers 1959:45). It had a number of 
structures of which the monument now famous as the Borobudur 
was one, most probably in the centre of the ordering of the 
entire sanctified space. The same inscription speaks of 
vividha-gana-samakranta-murttis-ca meruh in the previous line 
23: namely, the gods reside on the Meru/sumeru, an implicit 
allusion pregnant with significance for the structural definition 
of the Borobudur.
The pyramidal architecture of the Borobudur with its square 
terraces, three superimposed concentric platforms, crowned by 
a finiale 80without a clearly marked entrance but flights of 
steps on four sides68has puzzled scholars who have tried to 
designate it a stupa. Kempers (p.43) admits that "it is a very 
complicated specimen of the stupa". The Western scholars have 
employed terms like caitya, stupa, dhatugarbha (dagob), and 
stupika promiscuously, and Sumeru has been absent in their 
architectural terminology. Sumeru has been relegated to cosmology.

34
These terms have precise connotations and they should be 
distinguished: e.g. dhatugarbha (dagob) is the innermost 
sanctum in a stupa where the relics are deposited, and does not 
connote the decorative architectural elements as employed by 
Kempers (1959:48 etc.).
The plan of the Borobudur is: 5 terraces, supporting 3 
circular platforms adorned with 72 latticed campanulae, 
surrounding a larger central stupa on a final and ninth terrace 
(Kempers 1959:42-43, Fontein 1971:16, Frédéric 1965: 158). The 
first five terraces are the five storeys of Sumeru, as we find 
in Nepalese temples, in Tibetan texts, on thaňka paintings, 
and as is well known from the oral traditions of Indonesia 
(Fontein 1971:14) that the Chandi is a Sumeru.
In Nepal, the tradition of temples on a stepped pyramidal 
base has continued down to our times. The best known of the 
'pagoda-style' temples or dega is the five-storeyed temple of 
the Newars at Bhaktapur is Nyatapola dega. It stands on and 
above a five-stepped pyramid. The five super-imposed platforms 
diminish in size from bottom to top and are linked together by 
staircase which is situated on the southern façade. On the 
topmost platform is the temple, built from brick and wood, with 
five superimposed roofs of decreasing size and similar form. 
The garbha-grha is situated within.
"Another temple, dedicated to siva in Khauma tol, previously 
rose above five stepped terraces. Today the base alone remains, 
consisting of five stepped terraces. The upper part, where the 
garbha-grha used to be, was destroyed by earthquakes, the most 
violent of which took place in 1934. According to the inscription 
which is to be found close by the temple, it was built in 1667 
by Jagatprakasa Malla.
"One should also draw attention to another temple which is 
known as Fasi Dega and is dedicated to Śiva. It has the same
five-terraced pyramidal base. The upper part was destroyed
during the 1934 earthquake.Fasi Dega and the Khauma tol Dega

35
have bases of stone, and not of bricks as is the case of 
Nyatapola.
"All the above-mentioned temples have entrances situated 
on the southern façade and a staircase which links the terraces 
together. On either side of the staircase on the southern 
façade of Nyatapola dega are to be found ranks of huge 
guardians: at the bottom are the giants Jaya Malla and Bhatta, 
athletes in the king's service and reputed to have the strength 
of ten men; above them are two elephants ten times stronger 
yet; then, continuing this decimal progress on in muscular 
vigour, two lions, two tigers and the goddesses Singhini and 
Vyaghrini". (A. Macdonald & Anca Stahl, Newar Art, in press). 
Prof. Wayman (1973:104 pl.9,102-109) has illustrated the 
configuration of the Sume ru on a Tibetan thanka scroll (compare 
Matsunaga 1969:39). It has five terraces which constitute 
Mount Sumeru (p.108). Above the five-storeyed Sumeru is a 
cloud atop which rests a three-storeyed palace. On top of the 
palace roof is a tiny structure. This becomes clear in Mkhas- 
grub-rje's (A.D. 1385-1438) fundamentals of the Buddhist tantras. 
In his prescription of the generation of the residence 
(adhārot patti) he says: "In the middle of this ocean, he 
imagines a four-sided Sume ru mountain, adorned on all four 
sides with rows of stairs made respectively7 of gold, silver, 
sapphire (indranila), and amber, all over which spring up wish- 
granting trees (kalpa-vrksa) decorated with a thousand fluttering 
victory banners.
"Above it, he is to imagine a canopy (vitana) appearing7 
in an instant. On top of that canopy, he generates the 
complete characteristics of an eaved palace (kütāgāra) and 
generates within it various seats; and he may also generate 
within the palace stupas of the varieties 'victorious' and 
'radi ant'." (Lessing/Wayman 1968:175). Thereafter the deities 
are invited to be resident (adheya) in the sanctified space.

36
This scheme corresponds to the Borobudur as follows:
5 terraces = five storeys of the Sumeru
3 circular platforms = base of kūṭāgāra (palace) 
1 large central finiale = stūpa
There must have been a wooden pavilion (kuṭāgāra) atop the 
three circular platforms. We know that Borobudur had wooden 
structures which have perished. Octagonal stone bases of the 
foundations of the monastic building have been found to the 
west of the monument. The discovery of bronze nails points 
that the building was of wood (Frédéric 1965:160). The pinnacle 
seems to have been octagonal and ended in a number of horizontal 
incisions, three parasols in succession and a jewel at the top 
(Kempers 1959:48). The horizontal incisions in the pinnacle 
must have held the wooden kūtāgāra, and other architectural 
end-elements.
As indicated above and as will be corroborated further on, 
the Borobudur is a mandala dedicated to Vairocana of the 
Vajradhātu. The abode of Vairocana is atop Sumeru as it is 
clearly pointed out in the Ni spanna-yogavali in the chapter on 
the Vajradhatu-mandala that Lord Vairocana is seated in the 
vajraparyanka posture in the centre of the kutagara situated 
on Sumeru: Sumerüpari kūtāgārani tasya madhye visvambho jasya 
karni kayam bhagavan Vairocano (text p.44 (19). In the 
Japanese tradition of the Kongōchōkyo (Vajrasekhara-tantra) 
Vairocana ascended Mount Sumeru to reveal the mandala to sentient 
beings (Matsunaga 1969:203, Sumeru depicted on p.39). In his 
work on the fundamentals of the tantras, Mkhas-grub-rje says: 
After completing the five abhi sambodhi, he became samyaksambudāha 
Mahavai rocana, proceeded to the summit of Mount Sumeru and 
proclaimed the yoga tantras (Lessing/Wayman 1968:27,29,35), 
that is, the Tattvasangraha, its explanatory Vajrasekhara- 
tantra and other tantras. Moens (1960:386) has spoken of the 
Paradise of Vairocana, the Sahalokadhatu, on top of the 
rupadhatu in the context of the Borobudur-Mendut-Pawon complex.

37
Yet the general feeling in the scholarly world has tended to 
consider the Borobudur as 'the great stupa' (Frédéric 1965:160), 
an interpretation which had insuperable difficulties in terms 
of the classic type, like the absence of a clearly marked 
entrance. Instead it has four entrance-stairs in the four 
directions as is appropriate to Vajradhātu Vairo cana mandala 
situated on the four-sided Sumeru mountain, adorned with rows 
of stairs on all four sides (Lessing/Wayman 1968:175). The 
round terraces atop the Sumeru are the foundations for the 
Classic type of the abode of Vairocana, which is sunya bhuvana 
or a round structure: sunyam bhuvanam vartulakaram bhavatîti 
sunya-bhuvanam (Dharma-kosa-sangraha, p.1).
The Vairocana Buddhas on the three circular platforms are

stupas on the first and second rows and those on the third. 
The pinnacles of the first two rows are supported by square 
bases, while those of the third by octagonal bases. The
perforations in the first case are lozenges, and those in the 
other are squares (Kempers 1959:48):
perforations
1st & 2nd rows square base lozenge-shaped 
3rd rowoctagonal basesquare perforations
This divergence can be traced back to the Avatamsaka sutra 
which gave rise to the earliest iconographic type of Vairo cana 
in the art of Khotan in Central Asia and China, In a passage 
interrelationship it is stated that 
describing cosmological 
transformations of the Buddha exist sometimes in the form of
of circle-nets, ... of all square things, Mount Sumeru, 
and of all sorts of ornamentation (Williams 1973:120), 
circles, forms neither square nor circular, and triangles. 
Thus geometric forms are specifically mentioned in the text as 
forms in which the Buddha sometimes manifests. These geometric 
elements are actually painted on the body of Vairocana in the 
paintings of Khotan. In Khotanese paintings octagonal forms 
on the chest. In the wall-painting Bal. D circles and

38
triangles are scattered over the body of Vairocana.
Two
interlaced triangles are shown on the stomach of the mural 
painting Bal.094, and a triangle on the lower arm of Kha. i.C. 
00118 preserved at the National Museum at New Delhi. 
The square 
bases and holes, octagonal bases, and lozenge holes reflect the 
geometric epiphanies of Vairocana enunciated in the Avatams aka. 
The lozenges are the placement of two triangles base-to-base, 
or a variation of the interlaced triangles.
The 72 latticed stupas enshrining the Vairocana Buddhas 
on the three circular platforms of the Borobudur represent the 
architectonic transcreation of the stupas depicted on the body 
of Vairocana in the Avatamsaka tradition as can be seen in the 
mural fragments from Khotan. The mural fragment Kuduk-tol 025 
shows stupa with a high superstructure, the legs of Bremen 
A 16164 have a very elongated stupa of several stories with 
harmika, the left lower leg of panel D.IV.4 abv. (British 
Museum) shows a stupa with high superstructure, and so on 
(Williams 1973:119). What were oddities as representations on 
the body of Vairocana himself were integrated into the grace 
of an architectural composition by the brilliant architect 
that Gunadharma was, who conceived the Borobudur in the 
contemplative solitudes of Mount Menoreh (Frédéric 1965:161), 
as an unparalleled monument trans creating adoration along the 
path of unending time.
THE THOUSAND BUDDHAS ON THE BOROBUDUR
A glance over the complete set of 132 Tibetan mandalas of 
the Rgyud-sde kun-btus comprising all the classes of tantras 
reveals that only the Vajradhātu-mandala has the Thousand 
Buddhas shown in the outer enceinte. The Tibetan Vajradhātu 
mandala, which follows down to every minor detail the Tibetan 
translation of the Sanskrit text, is the classical mandala
with 1037 deities11 In the Brahmajala-sutra (Jap. Bommōkyō, 
Chin. Fan-wang-ching, Nj.1087-T.1484) translated by Kumarajiva

39
in A.D.406 it is said: "I am called Vairocana (Jap. Roshana) 
and live in the ocean of the lotus-world... I incarnate myself 
into one thousand Buddhas." (T.24.997c quoted by Matsunaga 
1969:163). The Thousand Buddhas were, thus, an integral aspect 
of Mahavai ro cana as early as the fourth century.
In the Tibetan Buddhist canon, the Kanjur, the Bhadrakalpika- 
sutra (Toh.94) which describes the Thousand Buddhas, precedes 
Lalitavistara (Toh.95) the biography of Buddha: At the Borobudur 
too the Lalitavi stara is depicted besides half the Thousand 
Buddhas.
The Japanese Vajradhatu mahamandala follows the classical 
norm in representing each one of the Thousand Buddhas (Lokesh 
Chandra 1972: scheme II, Tajima 1959:159) in the second enceinte. 
Frédéric (1965: 162) counts the Buddha statues at Borobudur 
as follows:

These 504 Buddhas, when doubled, make the sacred number of 
504x2=1008. As already shown before, about a thousand statues 
are actually provided for at Chandi Sewu. Following a cue 
from Goris, Stutterheim (1956:59-61) tried to explain "the 
curious composition of the figure 504" in the framework of the 
mysticism" whi ch 
San Hyan Kamahāyānikán. The "numerological 
he worked out into a complex series of figures on page 60 is 
ingenious but does not correspond to an actual system.
A Javanese chronicle does refer to the thousand statues 
at Borobudur: "a story occurs in a fragment of a Javanese

40
chronicle published by Poensen (BKI.1901:287) which pertains to 
the adventures of a Javanese crown-prince who died in the year 
1758. In this story it is said that the crown-prince, after a 
life of dissipation, went to the Barabudur to visit the thousand 
statues of this sanctuary, after which visit he soon fell ill 
and died. See also Brandes, Twee oude berichten over B., in 
TBG. 44(1901):73-80. (Stutterheim 1956: 16 n.20a).
It is interesting to note the pattern of variation in the 
depiction of the Thousand Buddhas in the Bhadrakalpika-sutra. 
In the Lhasa xylograph (a copy of which is preserved at the 
International Academy of Indian Culture) of this sutra which 
was woodprinted at the Zhöparkhang printery of the Potala palace 
of the Dalai Lama as the authentic version, we find the 
illustrations of all the Thousand Buddhas with their names in 
versified stanzas. They are represented as Buddhas in the 
dharmacakra, bhumi sparsa, varada, dhyana and abhaya mudras-- 
in this very order. This mudra sequence is repeated 200 times 
to arrive at the number of a thousand, without any other change. 
At Borobudur too, the same pattern is represented and to use 
the nomenclature of the Pañca-Tathāgata, namely, Aksobhya, 
Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi and Vai ro cana, is 
inappropriate and misleading as each of the Thousand Buddhas 
has an individual name though their iconography is restricted 
to five forms only which is common to the Pañca-Tathāgata. The 
description of the Borobudur has to undergo a total terminological 
revolution for the correct identification of the whole as well 
as of its constituent elements.
The discussion of the 504 Buddhas has been muddled and 
messed up by two factors:
(1) As early as 1836, Humboldt had suggested that the Buddhas 
on the first four main walls pertained to the Pañca-Tathagata 
system (wrongly termed the Five Dhyani-Buddhas by Hodgson). 
This has been accepted till now, as only this single set of 
Five Tathāgatas has been known till very recently. It has

41
held sway till today inspite of the difficulties it poses in 
the identification of the two Tathāgatas on the fifth main wall 
and on the circular platforms. To reinforce this quinary system,
every effort was made to explain away the mudras of the two 
Tathāgatas against all available sources, and even to point the 
possibility of a lost phase in Buddhism. "Krom started out from 
the Dhyani-Buddha system of Nepal and Tibet and tried to force 
the iconography of the Dhyani-Buddhas on Barabudur into this 
frame by tampering with the mudras." (Leeuw 1965: 395). 
(2) The use of San Hyan Kamahayanikan, which is not an integral 
text but a collection of fragments, was pressed beyond its 
limited potentialities. This is clear to my predecessors. 
Prof. de Leeuw says that Stutterheim "based himself on the 
preconception that the Buddhist system of Barabudur was exactly 
the same as that expounded in the San Hyan Kamahāyāni kan. In 
this respect he therefore made the same mistake as Krom, taking 
a given system as his starting-point and trying to fit the 
iconography of Barabudur into it. However, when adhering less 
strictly to the San Hyan Kamahāyāni kan he put forward certain 
improvements in the explanation of Barabudur's iconography, such 
as his suggestion that the images on the first main wall do not 
represent four Dhyani-Buddhas, but either four Manusi -Buddhas 
or four forms of Gautama." (Leeuw 1965: 395).
VARIATION IN THE FIVE TATHAGATAS
Though the number of Five Tathāgatas remained constant, 
their names, distinguishing features and placement has varied 
in different textual traditions.
At the beginning of the fifth century, the four Buddhas 
Akṣobhya, Ratnaketu, Ami tayus and Dundubhisvara surround a 
central Buddha in Dharmakṣema's translation (A.D. 397-439) of 
the Suvarnaprabhasa-sutra (T.16.335,345) and in Buddhabhadra's 
(worked A. D. 408-429) translation of the *Buddha-dhyana-samādhi- 
sagara-sutra (T.643, vol.15 p.688; Nj.430).

42
By the end of the seventh century, Sakyamuni is the central 
Tathāgata, Lokanatha replaces Dundubhisvara in the north and 
Ratnasambhava takes the place of Ratnaketu in the south, in the 
9th chapter of Bodhi ruci's (worked A.D. 693-713) translation of 
the Amoghapasa-sutra (T.20.270). In the 22nd chapter (T.20.346b) 
of this sutra another set of five Tathagatas is explained: 
"Vairocana (center), Aksobhya (east), Ratnasambhava (south), 
Lokesvararaja (west) and Amoghasiddhi (north)".
In A.D. 709 Bodhi ruci translated the Ekakṣara-buddhosni sa- 
cakravarti-sutra (T.951, Nj.532) which describes five Tathāgatas: 
Sakyamuni (center), Ratnaketu (east), Samkusumitarāja (south), 
Amitabha (west), and Akṣobhya (north) (T.19.247ab).
In the Garbhadhatu mandala the five Tathāgatas are: 
Mahāvairocana (centre), Ratnaketu (east), Samkusumi taraja (south), 
Amitabha (west), Divya-dundubhi-megha-ni rghosa (north). This 
mandala is based on the Mahavai rocanasutra which was translated 
into Chinese by subhakarasimha in A. D. 724.
The five Tathagatas in the Vajradhatu mandala are: 
Mahavai rocana (centre), Akṣobhya (east), Ratnasambhava (south), 
Lokesvararaja alias Ami tayus (west), and Amoghasiddhi (north). 
This mandala follows the Tattvasangraha whose first chapter was 
translated into Chinese by Amoghavajra in A.D.753.
On p.43 is a conspectus of the Five Tathāgatas in the 
texts cited above. It shows that they were not immutable in a 
fixed standard, but subject to change, which later on came to 
be systematised in different traditions of various denominations. 
So whenever we speak of the Five Tathāgatas in the Nepalese 
tradition as recounted by Hodgson in the very infancy of Buddhist 
studies, we have not to take it as the system, but as a system 
among many, in a multiplicity of contexts.

44
It has not been realised so far that there are other systems 
of Buddhas, for example, the Four Buddhas in the Vajradhātu 
mandala of the Japanese Shingon sect, whose mudras are depicted 
in the Shingon-mikkyo-zu-in-shu 2.51-54 adhisthana of Four 
Buddhas: 2.51 Acala in the east, 2.52 Ratnasambhava in the 
south, 2.53 Ami tayus in the west, 2.54 Amoghasiddhi in the 
north, 2.61 garland to the Four Buddhas (Lokesh Chandra/Sharada 
Rani 1978: pref.15), 2.256 Catur-Buddhadhisthāna. Furthermore, 
so far none has cared to study the iconic structure of the 
depiction of the Thousand Buddhas in the Chinese and Tibetan 
traditions, besides their representation in the outer enceinte 
of the Vajradhātu mahamandala. In some Chinese and Tibetan 
traditions the Thousand Buddhas are repeated without any 
distinction: the same form is 'stencilled' over a thousand times. 
In fact they are a thousand epithets like the thousand 
appellations of Visnu in the Visnu-sahasra-nāma. In the Lhasa 
xylograph of the Bhadrakalpika-sutra referred to above, there 
is a distinct quinary pattern which is repeated, though the 
names of each of the Thousand Buddhas are separate and distinct. 
The Vajradhatu becomes a mahamandala because of the 
Thousand Buddhas, which is its unique and contradistinctive 
attribute in the world of tantric mandalas. The Vajradhātu 
mahamandala added to the already existing five forms of the 
Buddhas a sixth one with the dharmacakra mudra. These six 
forms of Buddhas were repeated 168 times to the auspicious 
number of 1008. That is why there are 504 Buddhas, and the 
niches and stupas enclosing these 504, symbolically make up 
the requisite double number: 504x2=1008. Thus the six forms 
of Buddhas on the main walls and circular terraces do not stand 
for Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, 
and Vai rocana, but are simply six morphological types to delineate 
the 1008 Buddhas in 168 cyclic repetitions in sixes (168x6-1008). 
The imposition of the nomenclature of the Pañca-Tathagata 
raised the insurmountable problems of identifying the fifth

45
Buddha in the fourth gallery, which should have been Vairocana 
in the "clear and systematic arrangement of Barabudur's Dhyani- 
Buddhas which works up towards a hierarchical climax" (Leeuw 1965: 
392-3). But this Buddha is in vitarka-mudra which is never the 
mudra of Vairocana. Vairocana is either in dharmacakra or 
dhyāna or bodhyagri mudra. If the fifth Buddha was supposed to 
be Vairocana then how could the sixth Buddha on the circular 
terraces be explained with his dharmacakra mudra which is 
appropriate to Vairocana. Foucher suggested, without any 
supporting evidence, that the sixth Buddha is sakyamuni which 
constitutes a "completely unacceptable anticlimax" (ibid.) to 
the consecutive phases of spiritual development. Krom (ibid.) 
suggested that this sixth Buddha is the Adi-Buddha Vajrasattva, 
which has been rightly and convincingly refuted by Prof. van 
Lohuizen-de Leeuw (1965:394). She has identified the sixth 
Buddha as Vairocana "in his capacity of Lord of the five Dhyani- 
Buddhas" (p.405): (1) because of his dharmacakra mudra, 
(ii) whereas in the Buddhist texts of Java like the Sutasoma, 
Kunjarakarṇa, and San Hyan Kamahāyānikan Vairocana is the 
supreme Buddha, and (iii) furthermore because several bronze 
images of Vairocana have been found in Java. She tries to find 
a justification for the six Buddhas at Borobudur in the following 
statement based on the outdated work of Getty: "When the group 
of five Dhyani - Buddhas was extended into a sixfold system some 
Mahayana sects raised Vairocana, originally the Dhyani-Buddha 
of the centre, to the higher position, giving him the name of 
Mahavai rocana. This system is not only found in Tibet and 
Nepal but in Japan also, where the Hosso, Tendai, Kegon and 
Shingon sects regard Vai rocana or Dai-ni chi Nyōrai as 'the 
Supreme Buddha (Leeuw 1965:405). In Japan, the word 
Mahavai recana (Japanese Daini chi) is a synonym of Vairocana. 
He is the central deity of both the Garbhadhatu and Vajradhatu 
mandalas, and therein he is one of the Five Buddhas: seated in 
the centre with the other four Buddhas in the four directions.
1

46
At the Borobudur too, the five Buddhas do not occur in their 
capacity as Pañca-Tathagata. It has been perceived by Prof. 
de Leeuw on p.403: "Krom was completely right when he rejected 
the system of five Dhyani -Buddhas as the basic frame of 
Barabudur's iconography," though she has ignored it on p.405 
cited before. Prof. de Leeuw identified the fifth Buddha on 
the fourth gallery as Samantabhadra, though she admitted that 
"these various possibilities will have to remain mere speculations 
for the time being" (p.416). Mus (1932:351) made a forthright 
assessment that the whole situation is teeming with "difficultés 
insolubles." It was never realised that the neglected iconography 
of the Thousand Buddhas, hitherto relegated to iconic tautology, 
held a key to the Borobudur.
The reliefs of the final section of the Avatamsaka, namely 
the Gandavyūna and Bhadracari, represent just the earlier phase 
of the tantras dedicated to Vairocana. They are in no way to 
be construed as the glorification of Samantabhadra as the supreme 
Buddha as has been done by Prof. de Leeuw, taking a clue from 
Bernet Kempers: "Thus the devotee circumambulating the galleries 
of Barabudur followed Sudhana from stage to stage on his way to 
spiritual wisdom. Together with him he would finally find the 
supreme master, the Great Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, under whose 
guidance Sudhana enteres Absolute Reality." (BKI.121.408). 
Earlier S. Toganoo had also suggested in his Ri shukyō no kenkyu 
'Researches on the Nayasutra' (Koyasan 1930) that the Borobudur 
is a mandala of Samantabhadra-Vajrapani (Bibliographie 
bouddhique IV-V/ 1931-33.97b ).
To this day, the Bhadracari has been preserved in the 
Shingon school in Sanskrit recitations. The full title of 
Bhadracari is Samanta-bhadra-carya-prani dhanaraja, that is, 
the great vow of S-nantabhadra, where he is an aspirant in 
quest and not the Supreme Buddha. His very role of the Seeker 
in the Bhadracari indicates that at the Borobudur we have not 
to see in him the Adi Buddha. Samantabhadra occurs as one of

47
the eight bodhisattvas in the Garbhadhatu mandala. In the 
Vajradhātu mandala he appears five times in subsidiary positions: 
the samaya-mandala (Esot.508), sükṣma-mandala (Esot.593), 
puja-mandala (Esot.666), Trailokyavi jaya-karma-mandala (Esot.760), 
Trai lokyavi jaya-samaya-mandala (Esot.837). Thus it is certain 
that his role in the Avatamsaka, carya-tantras and yogatantras 
is a minor one, and has nothing to do with the exalted position 
of the Adibuddha Samantabhadra in the Tibetan Nyingma 
sects, 
which was a later development.
CENTRAL IMAGE OF THE BOROBUDUR
The central image of the Borobudur enshrined in the final 
stupa has not been found, and its absence has engendered a 
continued controversy. The intrusion of the unfinished image 
has complicated the issue. Its solutions have varied according 
to the interpretation of the type of Buddhism represented by 
the Borobudur.
In the early period of its discovery it was "a huge mass 
of stones enveloping the top of a hill and containing only a 
small room in its central dagob" (Kempers 1959:17). Further 
on pages 48-49, he summarises the situation in the following 
words: "Inside the central dagob there is a large cella with a 
smaller one above it. During the whole of the 19th century 
there was a large hole in the walls of the dagob. An unfinished 
statue of a Buddha has been found inside the cella. It is 
exactly like those of the other Buddha images which show the 
attitude of touching the earth' (in the niches facing the 
east). Much controversy has arisen around this 'unfinished 
Buddha'. According to some it represents the Supreme Buddha 
manifesting himself incompletely in this manner. On the other 
hand there is reason to suppose that the sculptor left his 
work unfinished because of a mistake he made in carving one of 
the hands. Anyhow, it seems to be too much of a failure to

48
figure as the Supreme Buddha. It may have been introduced into 
the cella through the hole in its walls for some reason unknown 
to us. The same goes for a number of smaller objects found in 
the same place, such as a small 'kĕris' (kris)." We agree with 
Kempers that the unfinished statue was secretly introduced in 
the cella to compensate the disappearance of the golden image 
of Mahavai rocana enshrined therein, though Stutterheim (1956:56) 
feels: "Hoepermans' statement is no more than an insinuation 
directed against the Resident and the Regent, reproaching the 
former with the theft of a small golden image found during the 
investigations, and the later for having played the role of 
henchman by having this substituted by the first Buddha statue 
to be found in the vicinity".
The central image of the Buddhist vihara at Nagapattinam 
was made of solid gold, and the sthapati who made this image 
and enshrined it in a complex construction so that it could not 
easily be stolen, had gone to Indonesia. The Vaisnava saint 
Ti ru-mangai went to Indonesia to get the secret of the 
construction of the vimana and on return it enabled him to steal 
the golden image for the repairs of the Ranganatha temple. The 
details have been given earlier at the outset of this paper. 
A golden image was a lure as early as the 9th century, for 
howsoever noble a purpose, and why should it not be in the 
19th century. It is not an isolated phenomenon. "According 
to unconfirmed stories dating from the colonial period, there 
were villages near the Dieng Plateau which paid their taxes 
in golden statues, the most precious produce of their soil." 
(Fontein 1971:40). We do not know their where abouts.
The sthapati referred to above could have been responsible 
for the creation of the central image of the Borobudur. Even 
if there was some other sthapati, he could have hailed from 
India. The sthapati were in the Land of Gold, in Suvarnabhumi, 
and they would have insisted on a statue of solid gold for 
such a magnificent monument as the Borobudur, when there was

49
a precedent in the main image of the vihara at Nagapaṭṭinam 
A bronze statue of Vairocana, covered with being of gold. 
hammered gold leaf, has been found from Sidorejo (Central Java). 
Significantly It can be assigned to about the ninth century. 
enough it bears a stylistic affinity with South Indian sculpture 
(Fontein 1971:148 no.27). The cumulative effect of the evidence 
adduced so far indicates that the central image should have been 
We have already of solid gold and consequently small in size. 
pointed out that the Vajradhātu Vairocana was the main deity 
of sailendra Buddhism. In the Old Javanese kakawins Arjunavi jaya 
26.4 and Sutasoma 32.10, 139.9 Jinapati Vairocana is characterised 
by his hands in the bodhyagri mudra which is exclusive to the 
Vajradhatu Vairocana. The Prince Sutasoma is compared to 
Vairocana several times in the Sutasoma Kakawin (Santoso 1975: 
618-620) which testifies to the high popularity of Vajradhātu 
Vairocana in the Classical periods of Indonesian history. The 
entire architectural composition of the Borobudur down to the 
minute details of the geometric designs of the lattices of the 
stupas on the circular platforms, favours, sustains and 
strengthens the idea that it is an adhara for the mandala of 
the Vajradhātu. Before proceding further it may be specified 
that there are two major steps in tantric worship: (i) generation 
of the residence for the deities (adharot patti) and (ii) evocation 
of the deities to be residents (adheya) therein. Descriptions 
of the generation of the residence for the deities is given in 
the tantras, which has been summarised by Mkhas-grub-rje 
(Lessing/Wayman 1968:175) in a vivid manner. From this we can 
say that the entire structure of the Borobudur, including the 
now vanished kūtāgāra, was the residence or adhara for the 
deities. It was to be followed by the second stage of the 
deities taking residence herein. Who were these deities? They 
were the 37 deities of the Vajradhatu mandala: the central 
Vai rocana surrounded by 36 deities. The images of these

50
36 deities must have been fashioned out of seven precious metals. 
They should have been placed in the now-vanished wooden kūtāgara. 
The dichotomy of the adhara and adheya was reflected in the 
construction itself: adhara was a fixed and permanent construction 
in stone and the adheya or the images of precious metal were 
portable to 'take' residence in every ritual--true to hieratic 
requirements.
The 'unfinished image' is a sculptor's error, without 
any place in the scheme of the Borobudur. All the confusion 
has arisen because scholars were not aware of the basic fact 
that NO unfinished, faulty, or broken image is ever installed 
in a sacred place. The haze deepened as the Buddhism of 
Borobudur was appraised as an eclectic conglomeration: so efforts 
could be made over the years to devise a system to fit in the 
'unfinished image'. There were no criteria to arouse suspicion. 
With the precise definition of Sailendra Buddhism as yogatantric, 
we no longer need be puzzled by the 'unfinished image' or the 
vacuum created by the absence of any image to have the honour 
to be in the centre.
CORRELATION OF THE RELIEFS TO THE CENTRAL DET TY VAI ROCANA
The Borobudur has reliefs drawn from the Karmavi bhanga, 
Lalitavistara, jātakas, avadanas and from the Avatamsaka text 
of the Gandavyuha ending in the Bhadracari. A question arises 
about the relationship of these reliefs to yogatantric Buddhism 
whose central deity is Vairocana. How did the ideas represented 
in the reliefs culminate in the yoga-tantras? Karma-vibhanga 
represents the most fundamental level of the operation of 
karmic cause-and-effect. The jatakas and avadanas are the 
perennial effort of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas to liberate 
from the bonds of karmic causation, and Lalitavistara is the 
immortal story of Buddha Sakyamuni's discovery of the noble 
eightfold path. The whole represents the graduated path from 
the inexhorable laws of karma (Karma-vibhanga), its cessation

51
by the path leading upto Buddha Sakyamuni as propounded in the 
Lalitavistara, to its sophistication in Avatamsaka (Gandavyuha) 
where Sudhana the eternal pilgrim is exhorted by Mañjus ri to 
resort to Samantabhadra whose great vow (Bhadracari) is to reach 
the Paradise of Amitabha (Ratnakuṭa), and transcending them all 
is Supreme Buddha (Jinapati) Vairocana become Abhi sambuddha.
As we have pointed out already, the monastic complex of 
Tabo in Himachal Pradesh in India was consecrated to Vajradhātu 
The central 
Vairocana by Rin-chen-bzan-po in the 10th century. 
Beneath the 37 images 
mandala hall is dedicated to Vairocana.
A number
of the mandala there are frescos of the life of Sakyamuni on 
the right wall, and those of the pilgrimage of Sudhana along 
the left wall. The entire Tabo complex is surrounded by a wall 
with 108 stūpas. Both the series of the life of Sakyamuni and 
the journey of Sudhana are also sculpted at Borobudur. 
of stupas have been found at a distance from the Borobudur. 
These may have topped the ramparts of the Borobudur complex.

the pilgrimage of Sudhana and Vairocana goes back to an early 
period, at the latest, the fourth century when the first Chinese 
translation of the Avatamsaka took place. Vairocana is the
lord of the Kusuma-tala-garbha-vyuhalahkara-lokadhatu (Rengedai 
sekai, JEBD 1965:17b) in the Avatamsaka and also in the 
Brahmajala-sutra (T. 21, Nj.554) which was translated into Chinese 
by Shiken during A.D.223-253.
The Avatamsaka school had two main representations of: 
(1) the image of Vairocana as the Buddha of this school, and 
(2) the narrative paintings or sculptures of the pilgrimage of 
Sudhana. Mi chèle Pirazzoli -t 'Serstevens says that the 
Avatansaka iconography of Vai rocana "first appeared at Khotan, 
passed on to Kuca (Kizi 1 Cave), then appeared in cave no.425/P.135 
of Tun-huang (early sixth century)". She goes on to describe 
a Chinese image of the Sui dynasty (A.D.589-618) at the Musée 
Guimet: "The right hand makes the gesture of abhayamudra; the 
On the front of the cloak are left hand, that of varamudra. 
modelled the sun, the moon, two apsaras, Mount Meru (formed of 
a rock beaten by waves and borne by interlaced dragons), a 
Buddhist sanctuary, and scenes of hell. On the back, which is 
flatter, other personages modelled in relief evoke the Six Ways 
(the damned, preta, wild animals, asura, humans, and Buddha), 
as well as Kşitigarbha (King of Hell) sitting on a throne. The 
theme is borrowed from the Avatams aka Sutra which makes 
Vairocana the master of all the universe" (Auboyer 1975:107). 
The earliest representations of Vairocana originated in the 
Avatamsaka, which were to evolve later on into the Vairocana 
of the yogatantras.
The evolution of Buddhist thought leading from the earliest 
through the One Vehicle of Avatamsaka to the Vajradhatu Vairocana 
in the Shingon School has been propounded by Köbo Daishi at the

53
beginning of the ninth century, as Ten Stages of spiritual 
progress (not to be confused with the daśa-bhumi). They are
cited below in the words of Takakusu (1956: 149):
"The critical classification of the Buddha's teaching 
proposed by Kōbō Dai shi is in reality the Ten Stages of spiritual 
development:
1.Various paths of blind life driven by the instinctive
impulse (the stage of common people);
2.The Vehicle of human beings striving to have a moral life 
(the stage of Confucianism);
3.The Vehicle of heavenly beings striving to have a 
supernatural power (the stage of Taoism and Brahmani sm)-- 
these three are the wordly Vehicles;
4.The Vehicle of the direct pupils of the Buddha (śrāvaka) 
striving for a higher spiritual life as in Hinayana Schools, 
Kusha Abhi dharmakosa7, and Jojitsu Satyasiddhi (stage 
of direct disciples);
5.The Vehicle of the self-enlightened ones (pratyeka-buddha) 
enjoying self-enlightenment yet falling into egoism; 
6-7The doctrine of Three Vehicles, holding the three Vehicles 
as real (the stages of the Sanron Madhyamika7 and Hosso 
Yogacara Schools);
8-9. The doctrine of One Vehicle holding the one Vehicle as 
real (the stages of the Kegon Avatams aka and Tendai 
Schools);
10. The Diamond Vehicle as held by the Shingon School.
These stages, coming one above the other, show the timely 
progress of the human mind."
The above scheme of Kobo Daishi is a striking parallel to 
the various sculptural components of the Borobodur which represent 
the different strata of Buddhist thought leading to the Vajradhatu 
m
Vairocana of the yoga-tantras--all harmonised by a consumate 
architectural genius.

In the Tibetan The Avatamsaka is a mahavai pulya-sutra. 
Kanjur the full title is Buddhavataṁsaka nama mahavai pulya- 
sutra (Toh.44). So also in the Chinese translation, which can 
be rendered verbatim as mahavai pulya Buddhavatamsaka sutra 
(Nj.87-T.278, Nj.88=T.279). The Mahavai rocana-sutra (T.848= 
Nj.530, Toh.494) is in the direct line of development with the 
Avatamsaka, Inspite of its being the fundamental text of the 
carya-tantras, its title does not bear the term tantra, but 
vai pulya-sutrend rarāja: Mahavai rocan-abhi sambodhi-vikurvit- 
adhisthana-vai pulya-sutrendraraja nama dharma-paryaya (Toh.494). 
While vai pulya puts it in the direct line of descent from the 
Avatamsaka, sūtrendrarāja indicates a further and higher stage 
of development. It is another glimpse into the intrinsic 
proximity of the Avatamsaka and the mandalas of Vairocana: 
reflected in the depiction of Sudhana's pilgrimage at Borobudur 
as a historical substratum in the onward spiritual journey to 
the mandala of Vairocana atop.
In the Tibetan tradition (Wayman 1973:232-3) too the 
transmission of the entire cycle of sutras leading to the cycle 
of tantras was divided into:
A. (1) the biography of Sakyamuni in terms of 12 Acts (mdzad-pa 
bou-gnis),
(2) compilation of the Word by the great śravakas in the
Hinayana tradition,
(3) compilation of the Word in the Mahayana tradition. 
B.Sutras which show principally the paramita-yana fall into
four groups:
(1) The Vinaya-vastu arising from the first promulgation (bkah) 
which was the Wheel of the Law concerning the Four Truths 
(Toh.1-7).
(2) The Prajna-paramita side arising from the intermediate 
(promulgation) which was the wheel of Law concerning lack 
of characteristics (1.e. the Void, S. sunyata) (Toh.8-30).

55
(3) The Ratnakuta and Avatamsaka arising from the last 
(promulgation) which was the Wheel of the Law concerning 
perfect discrimination (i.e. yoga experience) (Toh.44 
Avatamsaka and 45-93 Ratnakuṭa).
(4) The numerous sutras which pertain in some measure to all 
three Wheels (of the Law), arranged in a single major
class (Toh.94-359).
C. Tantras which show principally the vajrayana fall into four 
groups:
(1) Anuttara-yoga-tantra (Toh.360-478)
(2) Yoga-tantra (Toh.479-493)
(3) Carya-tantra (Toh.494-501)
(4) Kriya-tantra (Toh.502-827)
Subudove Thus we see that the evolution of the manifestation of 
Buddhism over the expanse of historic time was not disregarded, 
but was treasured in a structural systematisation of the Tibetan 
Buddhist Canon (Kanjur) and it was reduced to writing by Bu-ston 
Rin-chen-grub, and by others who followed him. It is detailed 
in an authoritative survey in Mkhas-grub-rje's masterly 
work, which is available to us in the English translation by 
Prof. Ferdinand D. Lessing and Alex Wayman, a work whose 
potential is yet to be realised for the history of the 
development of Buddhism. Mkhas-grub-rje sets forth the 
development into three yanas: the position of the śravakas, the 
teachings of the paramita school in four stages, and finally 
the teachings of the mantra school again in four stages. It is 
a sine qua non to understand the philosophical moorings and 
ritualistic context of the Borobudur which integrates in stone 
the same path of ascension: bravaka-yana-Karmavi bhanga, jätakas 
and avadanas of Sakyamuni; parami ta-yana-- Avatansaka (Gandavyuha 
and Bhadracari); mantra-yana-- Vairocana.

56
FUNCTION OF THE BOROBUDUR
The Borobudur symbolises not only Buddhist cosmology, 
thought and ritual, but also the dynasty that erected this 
magnificent monument to Indonesian glory: the Sailendras 'Kings 
of the Mountain' (Frédéric 1965:160). Sailendra authority 
faded away from Java not long after A.D. 824 (Casparis 1950:200). 
The instability must have been felt quite early and the Mendut 
and Borobudur must have been erected to preempt such an 
eventuality. The Mahavai ro cana-sutra was the basis for the 
dharani on the protection of the realm (Nakamura 1976:79). 
Much more so was the role of the Vajradhātu mandala for a 
cakravartin (Tajima 1959:152). The Mendut representing the 
Garbhadhātu mandala of the Mahavairo cana-sutra and the Borobudur 
symbolising the Vajradhatu mandala of the Tattvas angraha were 
intended to consecrate and stabilise the cakravarti sovereignty 
of the Sailendras in a syndrome of philosophy, ritual and 
architecture of the Twin Mandalas of Vairocana, who is also 
known as Ekākṣara Cakravarti.
We have parallels to this in the Hindu and Buddhist world. 
In A.D.587 Prince Shotoku built the Shitennōji Temple at Osaka 
in honour of the Four Lokapalas to overcome the rival Mononobe 
and Nakatomi clans (Matsunaga 1969:40 n.102). In Japan, I chi ji 
Kinrin or Ekakṣara Cakravarti, is a form of Vairocana which is 
identical with the Vairocana described in the Kawi text San 
Kyan Nagabayusutra (Bosch 1929:131). The polychrome wooden 
statue of Ekaksara Cakravarti dating to the 12th century from 
the Chusonji monastery at Hiraizumi (Japan), 75.6 cm. high, 
has actually all the attributes specified in the San Hyan 
Nagabayusutra buddhavarnaya, vajraparyanko pasthi taya, 
bodhyagri mudrani baddhaya, simhasano pasthitaya: he is of white 
colour, seated in vajra posture, with the hands in bodhyagri 
mudra, seated on a lion throne. It is a work of exqui si te 
beauty which can be realised only by a viewing of the masterpiece

57
or its superb coloured reproduction by Toshio Fukuyama in his 
Heian Temples: Byodo-in and Chuson-ji (Tokyo 1976, pl.22 
opposite page 29). The Chusonji monastery was founded by 
Kiyohara in a vision of grand proportions. The lion-throne 
(simhasana) was the emblem of universal dominion (cakravart1). 
In the Indo-Tibetan tradition too there is a mandala of 
Cakravarti (RaghuVira/Lokesh Chandra 1967:13.8, pl.31). It is 
one of the five subsidiary mandalas of the Pari sodhana-tantra 
(Toh.483-486), whose primary (mula) mandala pertains to the 
37-deity Sarvavid Vairocana.
CHANDI PAWON
Between Mendut and Borobudur, in a straight line stands 
the Pawon, 1150 metres from Mendut and 1750 metres from 
Borobudur. It is also called Brajanalan. It is "often regarded 
as a porch-temple to Barabudur, dedicated to Kuvera, the god 
of riches. The bearded dwarfs above the entrance, pouring out 
rings and other trinkets from bags, are consistent with this 
view" (Kempers 1959:41 pl.65-66). There is no other indication 
that it be considered to be dedicated to Kubera? It has small 
windows which "are a feature seldom if ever met with in temples 
with the exception of those of the type of Sari (P1.117). Here 
they are merely decorative" (ibid.). The word pawon means a 
kitchen (Casparis 1950:203).
In Bali, there are five stanzas to Vajranala, entitled 
(Pañca)-Bajranala-stava (ed. Hooykaas 1973:86), where he is 
described as seated in a mandorla of flames, pure like the 
autumnal moon, with three eyes and four arms holding a staff 
(danda), abhayada mudra, rosary (aks asutra) and vase (kamandalu). 
Each of the four Nepalese mudra-manuals that I have consulted 
illustrate mudras to Vajranala. The Pawon seems to have been 
a temple to Vajranala, who is connected with fire in the 
Balinese stotra: sarvagneya, santikarmani samiddha. The word

58
santi-karmani is an unambiguous reference to santika homa. 
Vajranala was the presiding deity of homa, which explains the 
presence of small windows as escape for the smoke of homa 
ceremonies. Homa is a distinctive characteristic of the tantric 
form of Buddhism. It had to be provided for in a special 
temple, because of the smoke. In the mantrayana or Shingon 
monasteries of Japan, special halls are constructed for the 
performance of homa. As the vajrayana of both Japan and
Indonesia go back to the same source, it is but natural that 
both follow the same pattern of giving such a prominent position 
to homa so much so that a separate temple was erected for it. 
The eminent and distinctive place of homa in mantrayana 
is also evident in its ritual. In the Japanese text 
Shi-do-in-zu 'mudras of the four rites', the four rites are: 
(1) the preliminary ceremony of 18 steps (juhachi do),
(2) Vajradhātu, (3) Garbhadhatu and (4) homa (Toki 1899:1-2). 
A special section has been provided for the eleven mudras 
performed during homa. The first mudra is the Kongōkaruma- 
bosatsu-in which is executed before the sacred fire is lit. 
The second is ka-ten cho shō in 'mudra to invite the god Agni'. 
This is the first act of the celebration of homa, an invitation 
to Agni to come to take his place in the middle of the hearth 
for his share in the offerings. The third mudra is to the nine 
planets (navagraha), & Signs of the Zodiac (rasi) and the fourth 
mudra is to the constellations. The fifth mudra is to the 
principal deity (Jap. honzon) of the homa ceremony, Acala 
vidyārāja, who is invited to take place in the hearth. It is 
the most important act of the entire ceremony (Toki 1899:137- 
146, esp. p.142).
In the lamaist pantheon Chu Fo P'u-sa Sheng Hsiang Tsan 
(Clark 1937:2.311-312), ascribed to the Lean-skya qutuytu 
Rol-pahi-rdo-rje, Jvālānala (Tib. Me-ltar-hbar-ba) is illustrated 
between two forms of Acala:

59
348 Aṣṭakapi Acala
349Jvalanala = Vajrajvalanalarka
350Caturbhuja Acala
This suggests a basic correlation between Jvalanala and Acala. 
Vajra-jvālānalarka coincides with Vajranala on whom the 
alternative name of Chandi Pawon Bajranalan was based. Chandi 
Pawon must have been a homa temple whose presiding deity was 
Acala. The agnisala or structure for homa is also called 
vajra-jvālā in the Japanese yogatantric Shingon denomination in 
the juhachido (Shingon-mikkyo-zu-in-shu 1. 29) as well as in the 
Vajradhātu-mandala (o.c.2.101).
Chandi Pawon is nearer to Mendut which represents the 
Garbhadhātu mandala of Vairocana. In the Japanese tradition
of mantrayana, there are three rites pertaining to the 
(1) juhachi do 'the preliminary rite of 18 steps' (2) Kongōkai 
'Vajradhatu', (3a) Taizōkai 'Garbhadhatu' and (3b) Fudo 'Acala'.
In the ritual manuals as well as in mudra handbooks the 
Garbhadhātu is invariably supplemented by an addendum pertaining 
to the fourteen mula mudras of Acala (Lokesh Chandra/Sharada Rani 
1978:3.274-287). In the Tibetan tradition too, the Mahavai rocana- 
tantra (Toh.494) which is the basic text for the Garbhadhatu 
mandala, is immediately followed by the Acala-kalpa (Toh.495) 
in the Kanjur. The Tibetan Kanjur follows a precise systematic 
order and the sequence of every text is determined by well- 
thought out considerations of interdependence based on doctrinal, 
ritual and philosophical development. Thus the juxtaposition 
of the Mahavai rocana-sutra and the Acala-kalpa is not a 
fortuitous chance, but an intentional indication of a close 
and integral relationship between them, which is validated by 
Acala is surrounded by flames, and in tradition. 
the Japanese 
Japanese symbolic representations he is portrayed by his flames 
and emblems alone. The very distances between Mendut-Pawon, 
and Pawon-Borobudur suggest that the entire complex was planned 
to the last detail to reflect to scriptural norms of the carya

60
and yoga tantras.Acala (Pawon) and the Garbhadhātu mandala
(Mendut) belong to the caryatantras while Vajradhātu mandala 
(Borobudur) to the yogatantras. Hence Pawon is closer to Mendut 
than to Borobudur. The distance of 1750 metres between Pawon 
and Borobudur is one half times the distance of 1150 metres 
between Pawon and Mendut. The numerical cosmology coded into 
the design and measurements of the Borobudur complex has yet 
to be worked out. The intricate system of numerical sets of 
time and space juggled into the Angkor Wat has been worked out 
by Eleanor Moron (1977:217ff) and it can be a starting point 
for a future study on the cosmic numerology of the Borobudur. 
The diverse elements from distant lands that have been 
pressed into a comparative pattern to bear upon the Borobudur 
in this paper, naturally pose the question of the feasibility 
of communications between these areas and the interflow of 
culture amongst themselves or via a core-point. The new 
identification of the Mendut-Pawon-Borobudur could be possible 
only by the compari son of the different expressions of the same 
tradition of the kriya and carya tantras manifested in twin 
mandalas of the Garbhadhatu and Vajradhatu, in the classical 
commonwealth of vajrayana countries. The Chinese biographies 
of Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra provide undeniable evidence that 
the traditions of these tantalizingly far-removed areas of 
Central Asia, Kanchi in South India, and the Sino-Japanese 
tradition converged on the very soil of Java in the person of 
Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra and that too in the early part of 
the eighth century -- a century which was to give us the great 
vajrayana monuments of Indonesia culminating in the lyri cal 
architecture of the Borobudur. Amoghavajra from Samarkand had 
accompanied his uncle on a trade visit to Java. There he met 
Vajrabodhi of Kanchi in A.D.718 and became his disciple. 
Vajrabodhi landed at Canton in A.D.719. A year later Amoghavajra 
arrived at Loyang in A.D.720. Both of them were instrumental 
in translating the Tattva-sangraha and other fundamental

61
scriptures of vajrayana into Chinese. In fact, along with their 
contemporary Subhakarasimha, they laid the foundations of
vajrayana in East Asia whose visual dharma were the twin mandalas 
preserved to this day in Japan. The presence of these two great 
teachers on the island of Java in person, is a unique historic 
evidence of the emerging world of vajrayana, converging to a 
unity in a shared cultural interdependence of values and forms, 
the remnants of whose manifold strands today lie disseminated 
far apart. The Borobudur is in direct line of descent in the 
conceptual genealogy of the Sino-Japanese mandalas and we may 
no longer wonder that for the interpretation of the Mendut- 
Pawon-Borobudur complex Japan provides astonishingly precise 
parallels both in its historical and living traditions.
The San Hyan Kamahayanan Mantranaya (SHKM) is a tantric 
text from Indonesia, with 42 Sanskrit verses, each verse followed 
by an Old Javanese commentary. Following the pioneering studies 
of Wogihara Unrai and Sakai Shiro, Prof. de Jong (1974:465-482) 
has demonstrated beyond doubt that the verses of SHKM are derived 
from the Mahavai rocana-sutra and the Adhyardhabatikā Prajñāpāramitā. 
Verses 1-5ab, 6-9, 16-18, 20-22 are from the Maha Vairocana-sutra 
(T.848, Nj.530, Toh.494); while verses 26-42 stem from the 
Adhyardhaśatika (T.244, Nj.1037, Toh.488). The Mahavairo cana- 
sutra belongs to the carya-tantras and the Adhyardhaśatika to 
the yoga-tantras. The SHKM thus finally proves beyond doubt 
the presence of the carya and yoga tantras in Indonesia and 
substantiates our identification of the Mendut and Borobudur 
as monumental stereomorphic expressions of the Twin Mandalas 
of the two divisions of tantras. Yet, this is a first step in 
the direction of a synthetic study knitting together the scattered 
strands of the fundamental unity of the Buddhist world on the 
plane of art and thought (compare Leeuw 1964:63).

NOTES
¹Translated into Tibetan (Toh.479) by Śraddhākara-varman
and Rin-chen-bzaň-po (958-1043). It was translated into Chinese 
three times:
(1)Vajrabodhi made an abridged translation for recitation 
in A.D.723 (T.866 Nj.534).
(ii) Its first chapter (out of its four chapters) was
translated by Amoghavajra during 746-771 (T.865-Nj.1020). 
(iii) The last and complete translation into Chinese was by
Danapala (She-hu, A.D.980-1000). It states at the end 
that the Sanskrit text consists of 4000 lokas in prose, 
that is, 4000x32-128,000 syllables. It agrees with 
Tibetan.
See Lokesh Chandra 1972: pl.1 (size 32x45 cm) and pl.699 
(size 96x106 cm). The large-size reproduction of the two 
Vairocanas is helpful in understanding their details.
3Bosch 1929:115 n.7 writes: "No doubt, the uttarabodhi mudra 
mentioned by Waddell, Lamaism, pp. 337 and 350, is the same as 
the bodhyagri". He is right. Waddell has reconstructed the 
Sanskrit from the Tibetan expression where the same Tibetan 
word can be agri as well as uttara. Our context requires the 
component agri.

THE BUDDHIST BRONZES OF SUROCOLO
by
Lokesh Chandra, New Delhi
and
Mrs. Sudarshana Devi Singhal, BHU, Varanasi
The latest work of Jan Fontein, The Sculpture of Indonesia, is a 
masterpiece of presentation and photographs of the statues of the Islands. 
It presents a detailed identification of the twentytwo statuettes 
recently discovered from the hamlet of Surocolo in 1976. Like their 
counterparts from Nañjuk they show fine and detailed technique and 
share stylistic commonality with them. Though identified, they pose 
problems prime facie. The four statuettes on pages 224-225 are evidently 
goddesses, but they have been identified as Vajraraga, Vajrarakṣa, 
Vajrakarma?, and Vajrabhāṣa? Fontein is not sure about these
ascriptions and he has question-marked two of them, though he rightly 
realised that they form a group. To find a clue to the re-identification 
of these and, if need be, of other statuettes, the largest statuette 
was chosen for detailed study. It is 10.2 cm and pertains to 
Vajrasattva. The sizes can be divided into three categories:
1. the largest 10.2 cm (only one statuette)
2.the medium 7.5, 7.9, 8.2, 8.9 cm
3.the smaller 5.5, 5.6, 5.3, 5.9, 6.0 cm
Fontein doubted the identification of Vajrasattva because of its 
"larger size than almost all pieces found in this hoard" (1990:230). 
Ever since Bosch identified the Sewu and Mañjuk bronzes with the 
Vajradhātu-mandala, the Vajradhātu has dominated all subsequent 
identifications. This has overshadowed other mandalas and has, for 
example, precluded the primacy of Vajrasattva as the main deity of a 
mandala. The size of the Surocolo statuette strongly posits the 
possibility of his being the mandalesa. Only this statuette has a nimbus. 
while it is absent in all other deities of the Surocolo hoard. The
royal canopy and throne found in other Indonesian bronzes of Vajrasattva 
seem to have been lost. The other five bronzes of Vajrasattva from 
Indonesia are:
(1)13.9 cm., Museum Pusat, Jakarta, no. 602a.

Nimbus around the body, canopy, rectangular throne without mounts. 
All the above statuettes pertain to Vajrasattva as a Tathāgata 
and not as a Bodhisattva. Vajrasattva as a bodhisattva is represented 
by an Early East Javanese bronze of Nañjuk style (MAK 1168, Scheurleer 
et al. 1985:176, Scheurleer & Klokke 1988:103).
Mallmann (1965:226) has indicated an iconographic confusion 
between the Vajrasattva of the group of sixteen bodhisattvas of the 
Vajradhātu mandala and Vajrasattva the Buddha. Bonheur (1971:138) points 
out that the Musée Guimet statue 2173 of Vajrasattva corresponds to the 
description of the sixteen bodhisattvas in the Vajradhātu-mandala of 
the NSP 19. But it is supported by a pedestal provided with antifixes 
analogous to the fleurons of the Musée Guimet statue no. 18290 of 
Vajradhātu Vairocana himself. These fleurons are found only in the 
representation of a rather small number of divinities and accentuates 
their character of supreme beings (ibid. 140). Bonheur also indicates 
that supreme beings as principal divinities of the mandala, have a 
symmetric disposition of fleurons, which are not merely decorative 
motifs (ibid. 125).
Fontein (1990:223) has distinguished two different beings who 
bear the name Vajrasattva: AdiBuddha Vajrasattva and Vajrabodhisattva 
Vajrasattva. The Adibuddha Vajrasattva "occupies the supreme position 
in the pantheon", and the : Vajrabodhisattva Vajrasattva
is one of a group of sixteen bodhisattvas in the Vajradhātu mandala.

The two Vajrasattvas are clearly differentiated in the Chinese 
captions and sitting postures of the Pao-hsiang Lou pantheon

In the Chu Fo P'u-sa Sheng Hsiang Tsan pantheon of Lalitavajra the same 
distinction in nomenclature is maintained in the Chinese names (B 69, 
B 193, Clark 1937).
Vajrasattva the Bodhisattva is one of the four acolytes of
Aksobhya in the Vajradhātu mandala (Ishida 2.115).
Vajrasattva the Buddha/Tathāgata is the main deity in four
mandalas of the yoga- and anuttara-yoga-tantras:
YOGA-TANTRAS
1.Nayasutra, chapter 1
Vajrasattva, two arms: r. vajra, 1. bell

Thus Vajrasattva is supreme and independent as the chief of
mandalas. That is why his statuette is the largest in the Surocolo 
hoard, and with the nimbus. The difference in style and technique of
the statuette can be due to fact that it was an earlier image that 
could have belonged to the ancestors of the donor of the Surocolo hoard. 
As an heirloom, it lent special sanctity to the mandala. Vajrasattva 
was the main deity in the Nayasutra which was very popular in the tenth 
century. In AD 960 the Nayasutra was read by priests at the outer gates 
of the palace to consecrate the Emperor's new place of residence 
(Visser 2.511).
The Surocolo mandala s may pertain to the reign of Sindok, who 
ruled AD 929-947. The anthology San hyan Kamahāyānikan (SHK), by 
Sambhara-suryavaraṇa, is attributed to his period. King Sindok founded 
a Buddhist monastery named Jayaměrta in AD 935 (saka 857) according to 
the Añjug Ladang Inscription found near Candi Lor. The inscription 
names the locality Añjuk, which is known as Nañjuk, with the addition 
of the definite article n. The Nañjuk bronzes were discovered near 
Candi Lor. He was succeeded by his daughter who ruled as queen 
Isanatungavijaya.The Calcutta inscription of Airlanga gives her the 
epithet Sugata-paksa-saha, which refers to her association with the 
Buddhists (Sugata).
The name Vajrasattva (written Bajrasattva) occurs only twice in 
Old Javanese, namely in the Mantranaya of the SHK, according to 
Zoetmulder's Old Javanese-English Dictionary. In the 12th stanza divine 
samaya is equated with Vajrasattva (san hyan samaya ta sira sinanquh 
bhatāra Bairasatva, Kats 21.23, Wulff p. 23). The 19th stanza points 
out the immacalate nature of Vajrasattva, who pervades the mind, who 
lords over all the Buddhas, and is self-being (sarva-buddh-adhipaḥ 
svayam). He is perfect, pure, and flawless being unstained by raga, 
and moha, the three poisons of the mundane world. He is supreme dveṣa 
among all the Tathāgatas (pinaka-pradhana san sarva-tathagata sira, 
Kats 23.18, Wulff p. 26). While stanzas 1-22 pertain to the Mahavairo... 
cana-sutra, these two stanzas 12 and 19 are not found therein 
(Jong 1974:469). They have neither been located in the Nayasutra by
Jong.
The cult of Vajrasattva of the Nayasutra was very popular from 
It was translated six times into Chinese:the seventh century onward.

Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra had been to Java before they arrived in 
China to spread Mantrayana. Both of them translated the Nayasutra. 
In Japan, the Nayasutra is recited daily, morning and evening. The 
first chapter of the Nayasutra is dedicated to Vajrasattva, followed 
by Mahāvairocana in the second chapter. It shows the primacy of 
Vajrasattva over Mahavairocana (Astley-Kristensen 1991:213). The 
Nayasutra could have been a text for daily recitation in ancient Java 
and the larger statuettes of Vajrasattva distinguished by the nimbus, 
sitting posture, throne, and mount should pertain to the Naya-mandala. 
The Surocolo statuettes, in fact, are of the Naya-sūtra.
The mandala of Vajrasattva in the Nayasutra is as follows:
Inner enclosure
Central deity:1 Vajrasattva
Surrounded by:2Ragavajrini, 3 Kelikila-vajrini, 4 Manoja-vajrinl, 
5Mana-vajrini (in the four directions)
6 Puspa, 7 Dipa, 8 Gandha, 9 Dhupa (in the corners)
Outer enclosure
Corners: 10 Vajtalasya, 11 Vajramala, 12 vajragita, 13 Vajranṛtyā. 
Gate-keepers: 14 Vajränkus1, 15 Vajrapas1, 16 Vajrasphotā (sphota 
'chain'), 17 Vajraghanta
It is illustrated by Shuei (AD 809-84) as follows

The central figure is Vajrasattva, who represents true enlight- 
enment.Around him are four groups of four, interpreted by Amoghavajra 
in his Gijutsu commentary (T 1004) as follows (Astley-Kristensen 
1991:17):
1 Wisdom Body, Jap. chi-shin = jñāna-kaya
2 Absorption Body, Jap. sammai-shin = samadhi-kaya
3Worship, Jap. kuyo, pūjā-kaya
4 Concerned with gathering sentient beings and drawing them into the 
Buddhist fold, sangraha-kaya.
The preserved surocolo bronzes represent 1 Vajrasattva, 2-5 the 
four vajrinis, 7 Dipa, and 9 Dhūpā.
Ragavajrint (2) is identical with her representation in the 
Japanese mandala illustrated above. She is clearly a goddess and 
cannot be the male bodhisattva Vajrakarma. Vajrakarma does not hold 
a bell. In the pujamandala he holds aloft a viśvavajra in both hands 
(Ishida 2.118). Fontein (66C) himself has pointed out that she is a 
female divinity. Ragavajra, the male consort of Ragavajrini, holds 
a makara-pennant.
66C.

Kelikila-vajrini (3) has been named Vajrabhasa (?) by Fontein 
66D.Vajrabhāṣa holds a tongue (bhasa) on a lotus, and not a stupa. 
Manoja-vajrini (4) has been identified as Vajraraga by Fontein 
66A.Her male consort Istavajra holds an arrow of Cupid:
66A. Manoja-vajrinī
Mana-vajrini (5) corresponds to the Japanese mandala. She has 
been identified as Vajra raksa by Fontein 66B. Mana means 'approval':
she is showing approval by clapping her hands. Her male consort
Manavajra has a similar mudra:
66 B. Mana-vajriņt

8
Vajrasattva is accompanied by sixteen goddesses in the prime of
youth. He is called Mahasukha-Vajrasattva in the Rishukyōbo/
Nayasutra-kalpa by Kōbō Daishi (AD 774-835):
4741
H
理趣經法金
His cycle is known as the 'mandala of Great Bliss'/Mahā sukha-mandala 
in Shuei. "Human desires and delusions are here revealed as the 
energies of enlightenment" (Yamasaki 1988:144). Vajrasattva is the 
absolute realm, and the vajrinis are the principle of the relationship 
between the phenomenal and the absolute (Astley-Kristensen 1991:120).

THE 17-DEITY MANDALA OF SIXTEEN-ARMED HEVAJRA
The remaining statuettes can be assigned to the mandala of 
Sixteen-armed Hevajra (NSP.5, text p. 14). This mandala has the 
following 17 deities:
1Hevajra, on Four Maras
2-9Gauri, Cauri, Vetāli, Ghasmari, Pukkasi, Sabari, Candall, pombini 
10-13Corners: Vamsā, vina, Mukunda, Muraja
14-17 Gates: Hayasya, sukarasya, Svānāsya, Simhāsya.
Hevajra is not found in the Surocolo hoard. He belongs to the 
family of Heruka. He is referred to as Heruka in the Nispannayogāvari 
(text p. 14). Zoetmulder (1982:1.621) records only one occurrence of 
the word Heruka in Sutasoma 125.10 in the description of yoga among the 
corpses on the battlefield: sumadhya ri turuna bhatāra Heruka. A stone 
statue of Heruka has been found in Bahal II, Padang Lawas (Kempers 
1959:75-76 plate 228). Heruka (an epiphany of Akṣobhya) includes five 
deities in the anuttara-yoga tantras: Samvara, Hevajra, Buddhakapala, 
Mahāmāya and Arali.
Fontein (1990:223) points out: "The three largest statuettes have 
lotus pedestals of a type that is quite different from that of the 
smaller bronzes, and are of markedly inferior workmanship. One of 
these three represents Siva. It could not have been part of the original 
Buddhist ensemble, which constitutes the remnants of a three-dimensionall 
mandala". These three statuettes are firstly the largest, and secondly 
their workmanship is far inferior to the other 19 statuettes. They 
could have been deposited under the pedestal of an image, and hence 
their inferior quality. From under the stone pedestal of the monumental 
Avukana Buddha in Srilanka five bronze images were discovered in 1952. 
They were placed inside a garbhapatra cavity of the rock. They were 
Brahma, Kubera, Indra, Yama and Varuna (Schroeder 1991:158, 302-303). 
Bronze images used as deposits in garbhapatras were generally less 
finely modelled (ibid. 302).
The Sixteen-armed Hevajra stands on Four Maras (NSP.5, text p. 14), 
who are:
Brahmayellow Skandha-Mara
VisnublackKlesa-Māra
Mahesvarashining (subhra)Mrtyu-Mara
Sakra
white (gaura)Devaputra-Mara
The four feet of Sixteen-armed Heruka are placed on the Four Maras 
(Mara-catustaya) who are in the form of Hari, Hara, Hiranyagarbha, and 
Purandara, lying supine (uttana, NSP.8, text p. 20).

10
Vajrasana Buddha sits on a throne constituted by the images of the 
Four Maras (SM.3 p.20, 5 p.24):
SM 3SM 5
Skandha-Mārawhite 
gauragaura
Klesa-Māraredraktarakta
Mṛtyu-Mārabluekrsnanila
darkhasyamasyamaDevaputra-Mara
Thus siva of Surocolo corresponds to Mahesvara, Hara, or Mrty- 
Māra in the above mandalas. He and the other two must have been placed 
under a Buddhist statue. Their workmanship is inferior on purpose, 
to denigrate their status in the Buddhist context.
Gauri has four arms in the mandala:
right hands: draw the arrow, vajra-chopper (vajra-kartri)
left hands: bow and cranium
Fontein's 66P on p. 229 is a two-armed Gauri with her right hand drawing 
an arrow on the bow in the left. Four severed heads dangle from the 
left hand holding the bow. They are the cranium of the NSP. Fontein 
has identified the statuette as Vinayaka with bow and arrow (?). 
Vinayaka has the head of an elephant without exception. The statuette 
does not have an elephant-head and cannot be a Vinayaka. She is 
clearly a female divinity with a serene and beautiful face: no chance 
of her being a Vinayaka.
Cauri has four arms in the mandala with vajra, damaru, hook and 
cranium. The statuette 66N holds a vajra in the right hand, while the 
outstreched left hand held "a now-broken and unidentifiable attribute" 
(Fontein). The left must have held a hook (ańkusa).
Statuette 660 holds a "mirror or the disk of the sun, while a 
few links of a chain, cast separately and probably made of silver, are 
attached to it. Edi Sedyawati has identified this figure as Vajrasphota 
(Fontein). The disk has an extension like a foot and thus it cannot 
be the disk of the sun. It could have been a mirror with a handle, 
but she is not in the posture of looking at a mirror. It can be a 
bowl with a handle and she can be Vetall who holds a bowl (karotaka) 
in her left hand. In the Pañcaḍāka mandala she has a chain (sphota, 
NSP. p. 75). The chain cast separately and attached to the Surocolo 
statuette may have been affixed subsequently to identify her 
definitively as Vetali.
The four corners of the mandala of Hevajra are occupied by 
four goddesses of music:
10Vamsa5.8 cm 66G
11vina5.8 cm 66K
12Mukunda5.8 cm 66H
5.4 cm66J
13Muraja

11
The three statuettes of vamsa, Mukunda and Muraja, out of the 
four goddesses of music, have been correctly identified, but statuette 
66K has been designated Vajragiti by Fontein, as he locates her in the 
Vajradhātu mandala, even though the other three goddesses of the 
Vajradhātu mandala (vajralasya, Vajramālā,
and Vajranṛtya) 
are absent. Fontein says that she "accompanies herself on the harp 
(VIņā)... shown with seven pegs". She clearly belongs to the set of 
four goddesses of music and is none else but Viņā.
The statuette 66M has been identified by Sedyawati as Hayasya. 
She holds an elephant hook (ankusa) in the right hand and the head of 
a boar in the left. As her head has porcine fangs and as she holds the 
severed head of a boar, Fontein would like to identify her as Sūkarāsyā. 
Because she holds a boar's head, she cannot be sukarasyā, who already 
occurs as 66L. Hayasya carries a hook (ankuśa) like Vajrānku§1 
(NSP text p. 15) and has a distorted face (vikrta-vadanā, Sadhanamala 
p. 179). The Surocolo statuette carries a hook in the right hand and 
her face is disfigured by the fangs. She seems to be Hayasya. 
Sukarasya (66L) grasps a vajra near the chest, and the attribute 
of the right hand is broken. It should have been a noose (pāśa). 
Sukarasya holds a pasa like Vajrapaś1 (NSP. p. 15).
The confusion in the identification of the Surocolo and other 
only 
bronzes arises out of the effort to accommodate them in the Vajradhātu

mandala. It was not realised that other mandalas were also prevalent 
in Indonesia. This is evident from the discussion of Fontein (p.227) 
on 66K who is in reality Vīņā, but has been identified as Vajragīti to 
accommodate her in the Vajradhātu system: "Vajragiti is usually 
accompanied by Vajralasi, Vajramala, and Vajranrtya. In some types of 
mandala these goddesses have been replaced by the four heavenly 
musicians, Vamsa, Mukunda, Muraja, and viņā. As the first three of 
this group are represented in Surocolo, it is possible that the goddess 
of song, who accompanies herself on the vīņā, is in reality the goddess 
Viņa, the fourth goddess of this group. This same uncertainty applies 
to the statuette from Nganjuk, for one of the Nganjuk pieces photographed 
by the Archaeological Service in the Termijtelen collection represents 
Mukunda or Muraja, indicating that the Nganjuk mandala may also have 
contained a set of the heavenly musicians".
UNIDENTIFIED MANDALA
The two statuettes 66R and 66S fall into a separate set because 
of their small round lotus pedestals. They have been identified as 
Vajranrtya and Vajralasi (?).

SUROCOLO
The name of the hamlet Surocolo is Sanskrit Suracala, that is 
Sumeru.The Jain Harivamsa-purana 5.373-376 gives Suralaya and 
Suragiri as the synonyms of Sumeru. Suracala means the 'Mountain of 
the Gods' like Sura-giri. The mandala of Vajrasattva was on the Sumeru 
(NSP. p. 8). Likewise other mandalas were also on the Sumeru 
(eg. NSP. p. 27). Surocolo must have been like the Ri-bo-che in Tibet. 
Ri-bo-che means the Great (she) Mountain (ri-bo), like Surocolo the 
Divine (sura) Mountain (acala). The expression mountain connotes the 
rising monumental form of Tashigomang in Tibet, which were complexes 
of cave entrances with myriads of icons, either painted or sculpted. 
They were also known as kumbum (sku-hbum). They were a specific 
architectural type, and were consecrated with several kinds of mandalas. 
Such mandala complexes could be seen in the Mandala Hall at Tabo (erased 
by time), and at Tholing (now vandalised). The mandala complexes are 
spread all over the Tibetan-speaking world, like the ones at Alchi, the 
Jo-nań Thon-grol-chen-mo of about AD 1330 (Vitali 1990: 126, pl. 82 on 
p. 128, fig. 16 on p. 129), Dpal Ri-bo-che constructed in AD 1449-56 
(Vitali 1990:125, pl. 75 & 76 on p 129), Rgyan-bum-mo-che of the 15th 
century (vitali 1990:126, pl. 83 on p. 128, fig. 17 on p. 129), Dpal- 
ḥkhor-chos-sde "sricakra temenos" or the Gyant se Kumbum constructed in 
the 15th century, the Kumbum Jambaling in Amdo in the birthplace of 
Tsongkhapa, and so on. The sacred precincts of the Gyantse Kumbum are 
called Dpal-ḥkhor bde-chen in the Myan-chun chronicles. It means
"śrīcakra Mahāsukha". Mahasukha Vajrasattva was a dominant deity in 
the Buddhist world. The presence of his mandala in the surocolo bronzes 
is no wonder. The central principle of the Gyant se complex is symbolised 
in its highest cella by Vajradhara.

COMPARATIVE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE GODDESS
USNĪSAVIJAYA
BY
LOKESH CHANDRA (New Delhi)
So far no systematic attempt has been made to survey the earliest texts 
on Uṣṇiṣavijaya and her various iconographic types. The general description 
from all over Asia as given by Alice Getty (1928: 135) suffers from serious in- 
adequacies, to illustrate: the Mongolian name given by her as rasiyan usnir-tu 
is not attested by any source: it seems that rasiyan has been extracted out of 
context from some passage. The Chinese and Japanese names given by Getty 
are Fo-ting and Butchō, which simply mean uşnişa: they refer only to the 
uṣṇīṣa deities in general which are five, eight or nine in number. Fo-ting/ 
Butchō are not Usņiṣavijaya. Her translation of Usņiṣavijaya as 'having the 
intelligence of the most splendid Perfect One' is again wrong. Uṣṇīṣavijayā is 
'crowning victory'. She again errs in saying that the three faces of Usniṣavijayā 
«are all, as a rule, sweet in expression». The right face is serene and the left is 
fierce in sadhanas devoted to her (SM. 191, 211, 212). Getty says that there 
«may be a small image of Vairocana» in her chignon (usnisa): it is not 'may 
be' but a must. Getty has confused the viśvavajra in the original right hand 
and the vase in the left hand on the lap as: «there are the 'four ornaments' 
falling from under the cover of the vase, and from cover itself rises an aśoka 
branch». The so-called 'four ornaments' are the four points of the viśvavajra 
and there is no branch from the vase, but the confusion can arise on a casual 
look even at the two figures illustrated by her on plate XLI, figs b, c. Getty 
concludes: «In Japan she is looked upon as the deification of the Buddha's 
uşņiṣa. Her form resembles the Tibetan representation of the goddess, but she 
is little known». No image or drawing of Usniṣavijaya is known from Japan 
and hence we have no basis to compare her form in Japan with that of Tibet. 
The Chinese tradition is also bereft of the images and drawings of Uṣṇiṣavi- 
jaya. The only images that we come across in China belong to the Lamaist 
denomination and are of non-Chinese milieu.
This article is an effort to present Uṣṇiṣavijaya in the Sino-Japanese 
tradition and a classification of her iconographic types on the evidence from 
Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan and Mongolian sources.

Names
In Uighur she is known by her Sanskrit name transliterated as Ušnisa 
vičai (Müller 1911: 27).
In China and Japan her names are: Fo-ting-tsui-shêng in Chinese and 
Buccho-sonshō in Japanese (Nj. 348 T. 967, Nj. 349 T. 968, Nj. 350 = T. 
971). In his second translation of the dharani (Nj. 351 -T. 970) done during 
A.D. 676-687 Divākara changed the order of the compound to Tsui-sheng-fo- 
ting (Jap. Sonshō-bucchō, Sanskrit *Vijaya-uṣnisa), though in his earlier trans- 
lation he had Fo-ting-tsui-shêng. During the years A.D. 973-981 Dharmade- 
va(?) (Fa-tien) retranslated the dharaṇī and used the term Tsui-sheng-fo-ting 
(= Vijaya-usniṣa, Nj. 796 T. 974a). In his other translation (Nj. 871 = T.
978) Dharmadeva(?) used another designation for the goddess: Wu-sê-ni-sha- 
tsui-sheng, in Japanese Ushinishasaishō, where usniṣa was transcribed and 
vijaya was translated. This indicates that the meditation of Usņiṣavijaya was 
widespread in China and Japan as a recitation of the dharani, but it had not 
crystallised into a popular Chinese name. Her images are not found in the 
Far East except in Lamaist contexts as at Fei-lang-feng in the 13th century. 
In Tibetan, she is known as Gtsug-tor-rnam-par-rgyal-ba in the transla- 
tion of Ye-ses-sde and others who lived in the ninth century (Chattopadhyaya 
1967: 176) and of Ba-ri lo-tsa-va who was born in A.D. 1040 (Roerich 1949: 
405). In all the four Tibetan versions (Toh. 594-597) of the Uṣṇīṣavijayā- 
dharani, the name of the deity ends in the masculine affix ba. In the Tibetan 
version of Neḥu-mkhan-po and Ni-ma-rgyal-mtshan (Toh. 598) her name ends 
in the feminine suffix ma. Mkhas-grub-rje (1385-1438) uses the term Gtsug- 
tor-rnam-rgyal (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 114) or its short form Rnam-rgyal 
(Vijaya), without any gender indicator. Her Mongolian name is Ušniq-a bijiy-a 
eke in the Chu Fo P'u-sa Shêng Hsiang Tsan (360 Icons) 247, wher eke means 
'mother'. The q in Ušniq-a indicates that s was pronounced as kh.
Texts
The earliest existing Sanskrit manuscript of the Uṣṇīṣavijaya-dhāraṇī 
is the one preserved at the Horyuji monastery in Japan since A.D. 609.
This dharani was translated/transliterated into Chinese fifteen times from 
the seventh to the fourteenth centuries. They are listed below in chronological 
order:
A.D. 676. Buddhapalita of Kashmir came to China and translated it under the 
title: Fo-ting-tsun-shêng t'o-lo-ni ching (T. 967 = Nj. 348).
A.D. 679. Translated and transcribed by Chinese functionary of the Court Tu 
hsing-i under the same title (T. 968 -Nj. 349).
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

COMPARATIVE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE GODDESS UŞŅIŞAVIJAYA127
A.D. 682. Translated by Divakara (613-687) of Central India under the title 
of Fo-ting-tsui-shêng t'o-lo-ni ching (T. 969 =Nj. 352). Divakara trans- 
lated it a second time in a fuller version under the new title: Tsui-sheng- 
fo-ting t'o-lo-ni ching ch'u yeh-chang ching (T. 970 =Nj. 351). 
A.D. 710. Translated by I-tsing (635-713) under the title: Fo-shuo fo-ting- 
tsun-shêng t'o-lo-ni ching (T. 971 = Nj. 350).
A.D. 741-774. Translated and transcribed by Amoghavajra as: Fo-ting- 
tsun-sheng t'o-lo-ni nien-sung i-kuei (T. 972 = Nj. 1421) in 11 leaves with 
the Sanskrit text and its transliteration in parallel columns for recitation 
(nien-sung/nenju 'japa', i-kuei/giki 'kalpa').
A.D. 741-774. Sanskrit text and transliteration by Amoghavajra, given by 
F. Max Müller (1884: pl. no. 1). It differs from the above (T. 972). 
A.D. 716-735. Translated and transcribed by Subhakara-simha as: Tsun- 
sheng-fo-ting hsiu yu-k'ie fa kuei-i (T. 973, not in Nj.) which contains 
directions for the rites of Usņiṣavijaya according to the yogatantric sys-
tem.
A.D. 973-981. Translated by Dharmadeva(?) (Fa-t'ien) in 3 leaves during 
the Sung dynasty under the title: Tsui-sheng-fo-ting t'o-lo-ni ching 
(T. 974a -Nj. 796). He translated and transcribed it again in 9 leaves 
under a new name: Fo-shuo i-ch'ieh ju-lai wu-sê-ni-sha-tsui-shêng tsung 
ch'ih ching (T. 978 =Nj. 871).
A.D. 980-1000. Translated by Danapala(?) under the title Fo-shuo tsun- 
shêng ta-ming-wang ching (T. 1413 Nj. 834). Another translation by
Danapala(?) entitled Fo-shuo shêng-tsui shêng t'o-lo-ni ching (T. 1409 = 
Nj. 878).
A.D. 963-1058 (arrived at Pieng-leang in 1004 where he died in 1058). Text 
and transliteration by Dharmarakṣa (Fa-hu) of Western India. Text 
given by F. Max Müller (1884) from the inscription erected by the Chin 
noble Fêng Chang-ming in A.D. 1147.le
A.D. 1326. Translated by Dhyanabhadra of Central India, of the kṣatriya 
caste, who arrived via China to Korea in 1326 and died there in 1363? 
(Hōbōgirin, fascicule annexé, p. 148b), under the title: Ushinishabisaya- 
darani (in Japanese pronunciation, T. 979, not in Nj.).
A.D. ? Translated by Hōshu, Fo-ting-tsun-shêng t'o-lo-ni ching chiao tsi i chi 
(T. 1803, not in Nj.).
From the above we see a continuous stream of Chinese renderings of the 
Uṣṇīṣavijaya-dharani, texts on its recitation and ritual, by eminent Indian 
and Chinese savants, including the great traveller I-tsing besides Subhakara 
and Amoghavajra, the two founders of vajrayana. Subhakara translated her 
more esoteric yogatantric rites, while Usniṣavijaya belonged primarily to the 
earlier kriyatantra stage of the development of mantrayana. All this goes to 
prove the widespread vogue of her meditation in the Far East, that even as
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

LOKESH CHANDRA
late as the fourteenth century, Dhyanabhadra during his sojourn in Korea 
felt the call for a new translation.
In Tibet there are five translations of the Usniṣavijaya-dharaṇī: 
Toh. 597 Arya-sarva-durgati-parisodhani-uşnisavijaya nama dharani, transl. 
by Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi, and Ye-ses-sde (9th cent.).
Toh. 594 Sarva-tathagat-oṣṇisa-vijaya-nāma-dhārani kalpa-sahitā, transl. by 
Chos-kyi-sde and Ba-ri (born A.D. 1040).
Toh. 595 same title, anonymous translator.
Toh. 596 same title as 594, translator not known.
Toh. 598 Sarva-tathagat-osniṣavijayā-nāma-dhārani-kalpa, transl. by Neḥu 
mkhan-po and Ñi-ma-rgyal-mtshan.
Mkhas-grub-rje (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 115), the chief disciple of Tson- 
kha-pa the founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibet, distinguishes the interrelation- 
ship of the above five texts as follows: The first and third are identical in 
contents and the divergence in wording is due to different translators. At the 
request of Avalokitesvara, Amitayus pronounced this dharani in the Dharma- 
sangiti cave in Sukhāvati. It has nine deities. The third text (Toh. 595) says that 
Yama the Dandadhara protects those who retain it. In the Chinese translation 
by Dharmadeva(?) there is a similar introduction: in Sukhavati Amitāyus 
addressed this dhāraņi to Avalokitesvara and caused many beings to be born in 
that country (Müller 1884: 34).
The second text in Tibetan (Toh. 597) was promulgated by the Bhagavat 
in the Trayastrimśa heaven. «When the omens of death appeared to the Deva- 
putra Susthira, he perceived that he would die within a week and would be 
reborn successively in seven lives as a dog, a pig, and other beings, and then 
would be reborn in the Avici Hell. He implored the powerful one of the gods, 
Indra, for protection, but was told, 'I cannot help you', and was led into the 
presence of the Bhagavat, whom he implored. From the Uṣṇişa of the Bhaga- 
vat's head rays of light issued forth, and the sounds of a dharani issued forth. 
Thereupon the Devaputra muttered the dharani for six days, and all the karmic 
hindrances which cause re-birth in an evil destiny were removed». (Lessing/ 
Wayman 1968: 115)
In their Chinese translations Buddhapalita, Tu hsing-i, I-tsing and Diva- 
kara (both versions) give a similar account in the introduction to the dhāraņi: 
«[At one time] Buddha lived in the garden of Anathapindada. Then there was a 
Devaputra called Sushṭhita, who was destined to die on the seventh day, and 
to go to receive the body of a tiryagyoni, or a lower animal, in seven successive 
births, and then to fall into niraya or naraka. Fearing these future misfortunes, 
he consulted (lit. addressed) Sakra, the Indra or king of the Devas, who in turn 
asked Buddha for his help. [On that occasion] Buddha uttered this Dharani, and 
made the Devaputra to remember it. By this merit the latter increased his life, 
and obtained the prophecy of his attaining to the Bodhi» (Müller 1884: 33).
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

COMPARATIVE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE GODDESS USNIŞAVIJAYA
The fourth text (Toh. 596) teaches the dharani and its placement in 
stūpas.
The fifth (Toh. 598) imparts the sadhana of the 33 Usniṣavijaya goddesses 
(Lessing/Wayman 1968: 115). Sixteen of these 33 Usniṣavijayā goddesses on. 
sixteen petals of the lotus are produced from the sixteen sunyata. Then 16 
sunyata are enumerated in the Yogaratnamālā (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 28 n. 
17). In Tibet a 17-deity mandala is dedicated to Uṣṇīṣavijaya with the 16 
sunyatā.
Iconography
Uṣṇiṣavijaya, as the main goddess, is without exception eighthanded and 
the attributes are fairly constant though their position in the hands may deviate 
slightly. She also occurs in a subsidiary role in the mandalas of other deities 
where her characteristics are quite different and she has two arms. As such she 
may be deemed to be a separate goddess inspite of an identical appellation. 
As twoarmed she has the following three forms:
Two-armed Uṣṇīṣavijayā
1. Uṣṇīṣavijaya appears in the zenith of the second circle of the mandala 
of VajraTārā (Nisp. 16.10). She has the cakra «wheel» in her right hand, while 
the left is in the tarjani mudra of threatening. Seated on a lotus in vajra-pary- 
anka posture and of white complexion, she wears golden earrings, and textiles 
of exotic weave. Her kulesa is Ratneśa (Nisp. text p. 39).
In sadhanas 94, 95 (SM.1.185, 1.191), she is yellow in complexion. In 
sadhana 95 (SM.1.191) she is called Usņiṣavijaya-tārā and in the decasyllabic 
mantra om Tare tuttare ture svaha she corresponds to the last syllable ha. In 
sadhana 97 (SM.1.198) she is white in complexion, is seated on the sun, holds a 
white vajra (sukla-vajra-dharam) in her right hand, and her left hand is in the 
tarjani mudra of menacing enemies. In sadhana 110 of Ratnakaraśānti (SM.1. 
129) as well, she is white and holds the vajra (v.l. cakra) in her right hand and 
menaces the wicked ones by her left hand in the tarjani mudra. The variant 
reading of cakra in place of vajra in this sadhana is highly significant in that it 
points to an early error whereby vajra inadvertently replaced cakra, which 
should be the appropriate symbol of Uṣṇiṣavijaya the feminine counterpart of 
Uşnişacakravarti.
2. Uṣṇiṣavijaya (Tib. Gtsug-tor-rnam-par-rgyal-ma) is the third of the 
Twelve Dharani Goddesses in the mandala of Dharmadhātu-vägiśvara Mañju- 
ghosa (Nisp.21.60). As such she is the personification of her dhāraņi. She is 
white, has one face and two hands. In the right hand she holds the visvavajra 
(like the other eleven Dharani Goddesses) and in her left a vase full of moon- 
stones (candrakanta-mani-kalasa-hasta). Her kulesa is Amoghasiddhi (Nisp.
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

130LOKESH CHANDRA
text p. 65). She and her ritual are described at length in the Rin-lhan which is a 
sadhana-mālā by the Panchen Lama Bstan-paḥi-ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal 
(Lokesh Chandra 1974: part 2, folio 58a 4). The whole of this collection of 
sadhanas was illustrated in the Lamaist album entitled Rin-ḥbyun (Raghu- 
Vira/Lokesh Chandra 1963-64). She is illustrated on folio 90a as one of the 
deities handed down from Sakyarakṣita. Her name is: Gtsug-tor-rnam-rgyal 
phyag-gñis-ma-Dvibhuja Uṣṇiṣavijaya, that is, Two-armed Usniṣavijaya. The 
mantra for meditation on her is given under the illustration itself: Om amrite 
amritodbhave amritavikrante amitagate amritagamini amrita-ayur-dade gagana- 
kirti-kare sarva-kleśa-ksayankari-ye svāhā. Om supratistha-vajrāyai svāhā. 
sarva-mangalam bhavantu. In the Japanese manual on the bijas and mantras 
of Shingon deities, entitled Bonshu Shittan shuji ruiju (Koyasan 1968) her 
mantra runs: vam/om amrita-tejavati svāhā.
3. In the 15th century wood-carving on the struts of the Newar monas- 
tery of Chuşya Bāhā (Guņākara-mahāvihāra) in Kathmandu (Nepal 1977: 
63, 64 fig. 33), Uṣṇiṣavijaya is the fourth of the Seven Goddesses, holding a 
fruit in her right hand and a nectar-jar in the left as guaranteeing long life,
Six-armed Usnīṣavijayā
4. Six-armed Uṣṇiṣavijaya in the Svayambhu-kṣetra, Nepal is described 
by Amṛtānanda in his Dharma-kośa-sangraha p. 60 no. 21: three faces 
(trimukha); six arms: right-arrow (sarakṣepa), garland, varada mudrā,

crest-jewel (cuḍāmani). Tārā sits in his lap, she has one face, and two hands in 
varada and abhaya mudrās.
5. Six-armed Uṣṇiṣavijaya in the Dharma-kosa-sangraha 88 no. 7: 
Usniṣavijaya, ekamukha. saḍbhuja. dakṣe hrdi. prathame visvavajradanda. 
dvitiye tathāgata. trtiye sara. kamale vajrasana. This means that Uṣṇiṣavijaya 
has one face and six arms: the right hand is placed near the heart with a staff 
crowned by a visvavajra, the second right hand holds a statue of Tathāgata, 
and the third wields the arrow. She is seated on a lotus (Bhattacharyya 1974: 
36). The attributes of the left hands have been overlooked by the author or 
missed by the scribe who copied the present exemplar.
In the Sacred Art of Tibet 1972: 27 a novenarian mandala of Usniṣavijayā 
from Kham is illustrated where she has six arms, but the attributes are not 
clear in the reproduction.
Eight-armed Uṣṇīṣavijayā
6. The usual and widespread form of Usņiṣavijaya is eight-armed. She is 
white, sits in vajrasana, and has three faces: the centre one is white; the 
right yellow or golden, and serene, and the left black or blue, and fierce. Each 
has a third eye on the forehead. She has eight hands:

She is in the prime of her youth, clad in divine garments, decked with all 
ornaments, resides in the sanctum of the caitya (caitya-guha-garbha-sthitām), 
and bears the image of Vairocana on her crown (vairocana-mukuṭinīm, sadhana 
191 of the Sadhanamālā 2.394). The sadhana 211 (SM.2.417) is more specific in 
defining the attributes of the second right hand as : Amitabha on a red lotus 
(rakt-aravindastha-Amitabha-jina). The same sadhana terms the vase as bhadra- 
ghata. In this form, she was popular in Nepal, Tibet, Hsi-hsia, Mongolia and 
Buryatia (USSR). She has been described by several European savants like 
Albert Grünwedel (1900: 150, illus: fig. 107, 123, 125) on the basis of sadhana. 
191 of the Sadhanamālā. Amarendra Nath (1977: 41-44) has identified a 
Hsi-hsia print from Kharakhoto as pertaining to Usņiṣavijaya. This print 
(KKII 0283.a.xxi) belongs to the first edition of the Hsi-hsia Tripitaka, the 
Hsi-hsia kan, printed before the annihilation of the Hsi-hsia dynasty in 1227. 
This identification is supported by the prevalence of the worship of Uṣṇiṣa- 
vijaya at Kharakhoto. In the Ermitage Museum, Leningrad, there are two 
identical mandalas of Usniṣavijaya from Kharakhoto, differing only in the 
portraits of the donors, one male and the other female. In them Uṣṇiṣavijayā 
is flanked by Padmapāņi and Vajrapāņi, with two goddesses flying over, sur- 
rounded in the exterior square by Four Krodhas in the four directions and 
four more on the corners outside the circle of flames. It is gouache on wood, 
1.30 x 1.08 m. At the lower right angle, the donor is painted in Hsi-hsia dress, 
his hair is cut in local fashion, and he has a coiffure found in other portraits 
from Kharakhoto. It implies local production (Auboyer 1977: 79 no. 26, illus. 
on p. 83). A fourth Hsi-hsia representation of Uṣṇīṣavijaya is again in the Ermi- 
tage Museum, Leningrad, bearing the number Y-377, gouache on wood, 
0.183×0.12 m, whose style is very close to Pala art. Uṣṇiṣavijaya has been 
found many times at Kharakhoto, where her cult was widespread (Auboyer 
1977: 81 no. 33 illus.on p. 85). All these Kharakhoto representations of Usņi- 
ṣavijaya are prior to A.D. 1227. Even after the fall of the Hsi-hsia empire, the 
Hsi-hsia monks continued to be active in the erection of statues of deities 
popular among them and the publication of the second edition of the Tripitaka

in their language. The region around Hangchow became the centre of their 
activities and all the tantric images in this area are due to their endeavours. 
An Usniṣavijaya, flanked by bodhisattvas, is carved on the limestone cliff 
at the Fei-lai-feng-ssŭ near Hanchow in China. It is dated to 1292 in the 
inscription. The sculptural style «derives wholly from the common Sung prac- 
tice» (Watson 1971: 7), but the inscription gives the name of the donor as 
Yanglianzhenjia (of unknown nationality) who was the Director of Priests for 
the region and was responsible for the group of esoteric Buddhist sculptures. 
Mrs. Heather Karmay (1975: 24) points out that tantric images abound in 
Fei-lai-feng and it was an active Lamaist centre around 1300. It was here that 
Guanzhuba (Kanjurpa) completed the printing of the second edition of Hsi- 
hsia Tripitaka in 1302. It affirms the continued popularity of Uṣṇiṣavijaya 
among the Hsi-hsia people, who still must have entertained hopes of regaining 
the cultural glories of their past kingdom and worshipped Uṣṇīṣavijaya the 
symbol of crowning (usnisa) victory (vijaya) who had blessed them in the days 
of their majestic grandeur.
On the first plane of the Gyantse Kumbum which dates to the early 
15th century a chapel is dedicated to Rnam-par-rgyal-ma (Usniṣavijayā) named 
after her. She is accompanied by Avalokitesvara, Vajrapāņi and two devaputras. 
She is surrounded by her mandala inspired by the Kriyasamuccaya (Tucci 
1941: IV.1.201,IV.3 tav. 207)
Prof. G. Tucci (1949: 2.579 thanka 147 plate 180) illustrates an exquisite 
thanka scroll of 108 Usniṣavijaya according to the traditional iconography 
given above. «In Tibet there is a liturgy, dedicated to her, which goes back to 
Maitripa. In our times, with the Yellow school, wide circulation is being given 
to a handbook of the Panchen Bstan-paḥi-ñi-ma, called Bcom-Idan-ḥdas rnam- 
par-rgyal-mahi-sgrub-dkyil: hchi-med bdud-rtsiḥi bum-byan».
A. Neven (1975: 37 pl. 75) illustrates a 22 cm. gilded bronze of Uṣṇiṣa- 
vijayā (Tib. Gtsug-tor-rnam-par-rgyal-ma) of the 17-18th century. His obser 
vations on the attributes of the hands differ in three instances: holds Amitabha, 
the dhyanibuddha whose emanation she is, in buddha-sharamana (sic!)-mudrā; 
vitarka-mudra holding the pasa above; the kalasa held in dhyāna-mudrā. 
Neven has not specified the source of his information.
The catalogue of the Tibet House Museum (1965: 70-71) at New Delhi 
which was originally written in the Tibetan language by Tibetan scholars, has 
the following variations in interpretation «the second holds an image of Ami- 
tabha on a pundarika... The first left hand in dhyana mudra holds an urn, 
the second in karaņa mudrā holds a vajramālā near the heart...»
The eight-armed form is illustrated in albums of the Lamaist pantheon 
by Lean-skya Incarnate Rol-paḥi-rdo-rje or Lalitavajra (1717-1786) who was 
the Imperial Preceptor to Ch'ien-lung (1736-1795) and was the dominating 
personality of culture during the 18th century. His album of 300 Icons. 164
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

133COMPARATIVE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE GODDESS UŞŅIŞAVIJAYA
illustrates Gtsug-tor-rnam-par-rgyal-ma (Usniṣavijaya) with the mantra Om 
bhrum svāhā, amrita-ayur-dade svaha. The Lcan-skya Incarnate compiled another 
album of 360 Icons entitled Chu Fo P'u-sa Shêng Hsiang Tsan wherein Uşņiṣav- 
ijaya is illustrated along with her eulogy in Chinese, and her name in Tibetan 
(Gtsug-tor-rnam-rgyal-ma), Chinese (Tsun-shêng fo-mu), Mongolian (Usniq-a 
bijiy-a eke), and Manchu. A remarkable set of 766 statuettes was done under 
the direction of Rol-paḥi-rdo-rje for the Imperial Mother in 1771(?) and these 
were preserved in the Pao-hsiang Lou pavilion (Clark 1937: 1.xiii). This too 
includes Uṣṇiṣavijaya with the pedestal 6M3 inscribed in Chinese T'sun-sheng 
fo-mu (Tsun-sheng = Vijaya). She is repeated in this pantheon in a subsidiary 
position 6 B 26, with the same Chinese inscription on the pedestal. The album 
Rin-hbyun sketches all the deities described in the Rin-lhan (RaghuVira/ 
Lokesh Chandra 1963-64) which is a comprehensive and classified Tibetan 
Sadhanamālā by the Panchen Lama Bstan-paḥi-ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal 
(1781-1852 var. 1854). Rin-ḥbyun 64c illustrates Usņiṣavijaya as one of the 
ayuḥsādhana deities, that is, for prolonging life. It illustrates Uṣṇiṣavijayā 
twice more in the section on the Vajravali (R17b) and again in the section 
on the Snar-than brgya-rtsa (S2b) as Gtsug-tor-rnam-rgyal lha-dgu, i.e. Nava- 
deva Uṣṇiṣavijaya, Uṣṇīṣavijaya with her retinue of eight. Furthermore, she 
is shown (RaghuVira/Lokesh Chandra 1961-68: 3.148) in the Mongolian Kan- 
jur (xylographed in 1717-1720). She also appears in the Lhasa edition of the 
Bhadrakalpika-sutra xylographed by the Zhö printery of the Potala (Raghu- 
Vira/Lokesh Chandra 1961-68: 16.12) where the miniature Buddha held in 
her hand is replaced by the bija HRIḤ.
The full-fledged novenarian (9-deity) mandala is found in the Nor series 
of the Rgyud-sde kun-btus (*Tantra-samuccaya). She is one of the three Long- 
Life Deities who are auspicious at the end (RaghuVira/Lokesh Chandra 1961- 
68: 15.131). According to sadhana 211 (SM.2.418), this mandala has Padmad- 
hāri Lokeśvara to her right and Vajradhari Vajrapāņi to her left. Lokeśvara 
and Vajrapāņi are flanked on the outer sides by two devaputras holding chow- 
ries (camara-hasta). The Four Krodhas are found in the four directions: Acala 
in the east, Takkirāja in the south, Niladanda in the west, and Mahabala in the 
north. In sadhana 212 the two flanking deities are termed Padma-Vajradharau 
(SM.2.420).
A tenth century bronze of Uṣṇisavijaya from Kashmir, 17.1 cm high, is 
interesting for seating her atop a caitya pedestal rather than inside one. The 
donor couple sits on the caitya pedestal in minimal dimension and the male 
appears to wear the Sahi dress (Pal 1975: fig. 70). The stone sculpture in the 
Indian Museum, Calcutta is elegant in its composition and execution. (Sad- 
hanamālā, vol. 2. clxvi, pl. XIV; JISOA. n.s.8 [1977], plate XVIII).
A Nepalese cotton scroll illustrating Usņiṣavijaya is dated A.D. 1416 
(28.5 22.5 inches). She sits within a stupa flanked by bodhisattvas, with
Acta Orient. Hung. XXXIV. 1980

134LOKESH CHANDRA
caityas interspersed all over the composition. The inscription records that the 
painting was consecrated by Jasarāja to celebrate the lakṣa-caitya ceremony, 
whence the entire mandala is overflowing with caityas in a delightful design. 
Pratapaditya Pal (1975b: 83 pl. 47) wonders: «she is the personification of a 
dharani (spell), but the reason for her depiction within the womb of a stupa, or 
chaitya, is not clear». When she is the personification of the dhāraņi, her form 
is different -she has two hands only holding the viśvavajra and a vase full of 
moonstones (see type 2 above). This confusion has arisen by the statement of 
B. Bhattacharyya (1958: 215): «it is not improbable that Usņiṣavijaya is the 
deified form of the Dhariņi (sic) of the same name included in the group of 
twelve Dhāriņi goddesses». Bhattacharyya has mixed up, instead of distin- 
guishing, the various contexts in which Uşņiṣavijayā appears in different forms. 
In sweeping generalisations, intrinsic interrelationship of particular forms to 
their contexts has been overlooked and they have been clumped together in 
baffling confusion. The concept of different types dependent on the classifica- 
tion of the multiple textual traditions of sutras and tantras has yet to be rea- 
lised and a well-defined morphotypology of every deity has to be worked out. 
This paper is a step in this direction. The second point is: why is Usņisavi- 
jaya in a caitya. Tarthang Tulku (1972: pl. 27) provides the following explana- 
tion: «Usniṣavijaya is an emanation of the Uṣṇisha, the victorious aspect of 
the Mind of the Buddha. This aspect cannot be conquered since it is not con- 
cerned with whether positive or negative forces are brought to bear in a part- 
icular situation. Only the situation itself is considered without judgement of 
good or bad and as a result any movement is a response to the situation rather 
than a reaction for or against it. Because Vijaya is an aspect of the Mind of the 
Buddha, she is often seen in the center of the caitya which symbolizes the Mind 
(citta)». Only if scholars had looked into the Sadhanamala, they would have 
found that in the sadhanas, Uṣṇīṣavijaya is invariably within a caitya: caitya- 
guha-garbha-sthitam (SM.2.394), caitya-guh-antaḥsthām (SM.2.417), caity-anta- 
ragatām (SM.2.420). Historians of art will have to consult original texts to 
interpret the pan-Asian tradition of Buddhist art. The paintings were origi- 
nally based on texts which are happily extant. They were worshipped accom- 
panied by the chanting of these scriptures. They can be articulated again in all 
their richness of expression only by resorting to texts in Sanskrit, Tibetan, or 
Sino-Japanese, whose neglect will only lead to doubts, misconceptions and 
misinterpretations.
Mandalas
In this paper we have referred to a number of mandalas of Usniṣavijayā. 
All of them differ in their structural typology, though the deities are fundamen- 
tally common.

A Comparative Study of the Tibetan, Japanese, Indonesian and
Khotanese Mandala of the Tattva-Sangraha
Lokesh Chandra, India
The tantras are invaluables texts for understanding India's esoteric texts, sculptures and paintings. They 
are a part of the creative tide of great thinkers compatible with the pantheonic sweep of India's immensity. 
They found their flowering in Central Asia, Indonesia, China, Japan, Korea, Nepal and above all in Tibet 
where they retained their dynamic development well into the middle of our century. Thousands of Tantric 
texts have been handed down to us in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, Sino-Japanese, and stray 
fragments in Khotanese and Indonesian which are venerable vestiges of a rich tradition now lost. The vast 
ocean of tantras has been classified into four standard classes of kriya, carya, yoga and anuttara-yoga. The 
Tibetan Kanjur and Tanjur precisely follow this scheme of classification and all the texts are systematically 
arranged accordingly. In Tibet every great scholar wrote on the tantras and a significant and outstanding 
part of this oeuvre has become accessible in modern facsimile editions over the last two decades. A look 
at the Tibetan titles in the Accessions List (India) of the Library of Congress will reveal the colossal extent 
of Indo-Tibetan trantra lore. Very few Buddhist tantras have been published in the original Sanskrit 
versions. To remedy this lacuna, the Tattva-sangraha has been brought out in facsimile by Lokesh Chandra 
and David L. Snellgrove. Its romanised edition has been done by Isshi Yamada. Both have been published 
in the Satapitaka series of the International Academy of Indian Culture. It is the fundamental text or mula- 
tantra of the class of yoga-tantras. The palmleaf manuscript containing the Sanskrit text of the Tattva- 
sangraha was microfilmed by Professors John Brough and David L. Snellgrove in 1953-54. Paleographi- 
cally, it can be dated to the eleventh century.
The teachings of the yoga school of tantras are set forth "in two works: the fundamenta! tantra 
Tattvasangraha (Toh. 479), and the explanatory tantra Vajrasekhara (Toh. 480)." (Lessing/Wayman 
1968:25). "Upon completing them, he became a Buddha as Mahāvairocana, the Sambhoga-kaya. Having 
become a Buddha, he performed the four kinds of marvel. He proceeded to the summit of Mt. Sumeru and 
pronounced the Yoga Tantras. Thereupon, he was born in the world of men as the son of king Śuddhodana, 
and displayed the method of the twelve acts" (Lessing/Wayman 1968:29). "Vairocana, dwelling in the 
Akanistha Heaven does not proceed elsewhere because he is the Sambhoga-kaya possessing the five 
certainties. But with the magical apparition (nirmita) of a Vairocana Nirmana-kaya having four heads, he 
proceeded to the summit of Mt. Sumeru and took his place in the caved palace (kūtāgāra) of precious

thunder-bolts. There he took his place on a lion's throne (simhasana) formed of the Bodhisattvas in their 
last life who had been transformed into the appearance of lions.......Thereupon, he set in motion the Wheel 
of the Law of the Yoga Tantra, including the Fundamental Tantra of all the Tantras of the Yoga class, the 
Explanatory Tantras, and the Tantras which conform to respective sections (cha mthun) of the Fundamental 
Tantra". (Lessing/Wayman 1968:215)
"The Esoteric teachings in the Mahavairocana and Vajrasekhara 
Sutras, Kobo Daishi says, unconditionally reveal the innermost secrets 
of that eternal samadhi of Mahavairocana; and by practicing Esoteric 
Buddhist methods of meditation, one can quickly experience the 
samadhi of Mahavairocana. In other words, one can attain enlighten- 
ment" (Hakeda 1972:63; with Kukai replaced by Kobo Daishi).
The Tattva-sangraha was illustrated by Subhakarasimha (A.D. 637-735) on a scroll which is known 
in Japan as the Rita-sogyara-gobu-shingan 'meditation on the five sections of the Rta-samhara' (TZ. 54, 
55, 56) with Sanskrit captions. Rta-samhara is a synonym of Tattva (rta)-sangraha (samhāra). Subhakara- 
simha probably intended to translate the tantra into Chinese, but did not do so. Vajrabodhi had carried the 
text on his voyage to China but it was lost on the way when the flotilla was engulfed by a raging storm. 
He could save its portions for recitation which he translated into Chinese in A.D. 723 under the title of Chin- 
kang-ting yu-ch' ieh chung lieo-chu nien-sung ching (Jap. Kongōchō-yuga chu ryaku shutsu nenju-kyō) 
which means an abridged japa-sutra from th Vajrasekhara-yoga for recitation' (Nj 534, T. 866). Here 
Vajrasekhara-yoga refers to the Tattva-sangraha. In Japan this text is known as the Ryaku-shutsu-kyō or 
abridged sutra. Later, Vajrabodhi's disciple Amoghavajra (Chin. Pu-kung, Jap. Fuku), translated the first 
part comprising chapters 1-5 into Chinese during the years A.D. 746-771 under the title Chin-kang-ting 
i-ch'ieh ju-lat chên-shih shê ta-shêng hsien-chêng ta-chiao wang ching (Jap. Kongochi-issai- nyorai- 
shinjitsu-daijo-genshō-daikyō-ō-kyō) =Vajrasekhara-sarva-tathāgata-tattva-sangraha-mahāyāna- 
abhisambuddha-mahātantra-rāja-sūtra (Nj. 1020, T. 865). In Japan it is most popularly referred to as 
Kongo-cho-kyo-Vajra-sekhara-sutra. The Tantric tradition waned in China and for more than two 
centuries the remaining Tattva-sanghara was not translated. The Chinese translation of the complete text 
was done by Danapala between A.D. 980-1000 (var. A.D. 1012-1015, Yamada 1973) under the title Fe- 
shuo-i-ch'ieh-ju-lai-chen-shih-shê-ta-shêng-hsien-chêng-san-mei-ta-chiao-wang-ching (Jap.Issai-
nyorai-shinjitsu-sho-daijo-gensho-sammai daikyo-o-kyo)= Sarva-tathāgata-tattva-sangraha-mahāyāna- 
abhisambuddha-samadhi-mahatantra-raja-sutra (Nj. 1017, T. 882).
In the early eleventh century it was translated into Tibetan by Sarddakaravarman and Rin-chen-bzan- 
po (A.D. 958-1055) under the title De-bzhin-gśegs-pa thams-cad-kyi De-kho-na-ñid bsdus-pa zhes-bya-

'visual dharma', as a mandala, in the form of a large painted scroll, as sculptures, or an intricately sculptured 
monument. Thus it exerted a mighty influence on the fine arts of several countries. It was expressed as the 
Vajradhātu mandala in the Sino-Japanese tradition, whose structure is beset with problems. A detailed study 
of the text, in relation to the manner in which the philosophic dimensions of the tantric vision were expressed 
in architectonic constellations, holds explanations of problems as yet unsolved.
The earliest extant Sino-Japanese representation of the Tattva-sangraha as a mandala is known as the 
Rita-sōgyara-gobu-shingan 'meditation on the five sections of the Rta-samhara' (=Tattva-sangarha)' done 
on orders of Subhakara-simha (A.D. 637-735). The Chinese colophon at the end says that it was given in 
A.D. 855 by the Chinese Acarya Fa-ch'üan to his Japanese disciple Enchin, whose Sanskrit name was 
Jñanavajra. The text has full six mandala (Esot. p.5"). Six complete or incomplete copies are known: the 
best is the one preserved at the Onjōji monastery. It was drawn and its text was written by Zenkaku of the 
Onjōji in A.D. 1194. the second copy handed down in Shakamon-in monastery of Koyasan (but now in the 
Sainan-in monastery) is dated to A.D. 1173. The third copy is from the end of the Edo period, copied in 
the 19th century and now kept at the Hōmyoin monastery (TZ. 54). The fourth copy kept at the Daigoji 
monastery has been lost, but its copy survives at the National Museum, which has been reproduced by Omura 
Seigai in the Bukkyo zuzo shuko. The fifth copy belonging to Mr. Sanji Muto of Kamakura and the sixth 
copy from the Asharajo have been reproduced in the iconographic section of the Taishō Tripitaka (TZ. 
55,56).
The painted manadala of the Tattva-sangraha was brought to Japan by Kōbō Daishi in A.D. 806 and 
it is known there as the Kongōkai mandala or Vajradhātu mandala or Daimond mandala. Kōbō Daishi in 
his Memorial presenting a list of newly imported sutras and other items (Shōrai mokuroku) submitted to 
the Japanese Emperor in A.D. 806 says: "Early in the seventh month I stood before the Vajradhatu Mandala 
and I was given once more the fivefold abhiṣeka. When I cast my flowers it again fell on Mahāvairocana, 
and the abbot marveled as he had before. Also, early in the following month I received the abhiseka for 
the ordination into the mastership of the transmission of the Dharma......... Then I received instruction in 
the mantras and mudras of the five divisions of the Vajrasekhara Sutra (=Tattva-sangraha) and spent some 
time learning Sanskrit and the Sanskrit hymns. The abbot informed me that the Esoteric Buddhist scriptures 
are so abstruse that their meaning cannot be conveyed except through art. For this reason he ordered the 
court artist Li Chen and about a dozen other painters to execute ten scrolls of the Garbhadhātu and 
Vajradhatu Mandalas and assembled more than twenty scribes to make copies of the Vajrasekhara Sūtra 
and other important Esoteric Buddhist scriptures. (Hakeda 1972:147-8). Ever since, along with the 
Mahakaruna-garbha mandala the Vajradhatu mandala has formed a pair of the ryobu mandala or the Twin 
Mandalas of the two classes of carya and yoga tantras. Kōbō Daishi had brought with him the following 
four forms of the Vajradhātu mandala (Manabe/Yamamoto 1975:;):
1. Vajradhatu mandala consisting of nine small mandalas, 1 sheet in 7 sections, 1 jo 6 shaku long. 
2. Mahamandala of cotton cloth representing 447 deities.

190
Lokesh Chandra
3. The central mandala of 81 deities, 1 sheet in 3 sections.
4. Samaya-mandala of the Vajradhatu mandala of cotton cloth representing 120 deities.
The original paintings were lost. In A.D. 821 Kobo Daishi ordered duplicates to be made. Even these du- 
plicates have been lost, but they are available in the copy known as the Takao mandala kept at the Jingōji 
monastery. It was copied in gold and silver lines on purple damask silk from the original polychrome 
mandalas in about A.D. 824. The extant copy of the mandalas in three pieces is kept at the Shingon in 
temple. Discovered in 1934, it became a National Treasure. It is dated A.D. 899 in the red lacquered 
inscription at the back of the lid of the black-lacquer box. The Toji mandala is also a copy of the original 
mandala brought from China by Kōbō daishi.
Alongwith the above Takao and Toji mandalas, the Kojima mandala (mid-Heian period) comprises the 
three fundamental versions of the twin mandalas. The Kojime pair is drawn in golden lines on purple 
damask silk handed down in the Kojimadera Kangakuji monastery, where priest Shunko died in his 71st 
year in A.D. 1004. Other important mandala scrolls are listed on pages 1-14 of the preface to The Esoteric 
Iconography of Japanese Mandalas.
The configuration of the Vajradhātu mandala has been a problem for historians of Japanese Art on 
several counts: (i) Which textual tradition do the prevalent (genzu) twin mandalas represent? (ii) If they 
do not conform to texts are they a synthesis of different transmission? (iii) Was it Amoghavajra who 
integrated the two mandala for the sake of his disciples or was it Hui-kuo? (iv) What is the relationship of 
the Vajradhātu mandala in six parts in the Gobu-shingan and in nine parts in the Genzu mandala? Japanese 
scholarls have debated these and other aspects of the problem. These questions have been sought to be 
answered on the basis of the abridged translation for recitation by Vajrabodhi (Nj. 534, T. 866) or by 
recourse to Amoghavajra's translation of the first chapters (Nj. 1020, T. 865) which were the only orthodox 
textual sources for the Shingon tradition. Danapala's translation of the complete text was not resorted to. 
Without the complete text of the Tattva-sangraha and its classification in Tibetan exegesis it is not possible 
to explain the complementariness of the Twin Mandalas and the nine section of the Vajradhatu mandala. 
In Japan, the fourfold classification of mandalas into kriya, carya, yoga and anuttara yoga is unknown. Of 
these four classes, the two classes of carya and yoga have Vairocana as the central deity. Hence they 
constitute the pair, the ryōbu mandala, the mandalas of both (ryo) the classes (bu) of Vairocana.
Now let us take up the six sub-mandalas of the Gobu-shingan. The six are:
1. Vajradhātumahamandale prathamaḥ padaḥ (colophon on illus. 37) 1-37 
2. Vajradhātau guhya-dharani-mandalam//4 (colophon on illus. 71) 38-71

4. Vajradhātau puja-mandalam (colophon on illus. 137) 105-139
5. Vajradhātau caturmudra-mandalam 140-144
6. Vajradhātau ekamudrā-mandalam. Samāptam Vajradhātu-mahā-mandalam 145.

The first four of the above sub-mandalas can be elucidated in the light of the four mandalas explained 
by Buddhaguhya in his fundamental commentary on the Tattva-sangraha entitled the Tantr-arthāvatāra 
(Toh. 2501) who lived in the middle of the eight century and is one of the three primary commentators 
of the Tattva-sangraha (Lessing/Wayman 1968:24 n.13). the four mandalas in Buddhaguhya 
are:mahamandala, samaya-mandala, dharma-mandala, karma-mandala. They are explained as: "In the 
case of the maha-mandalas, because the array of deities is an arrangement in the Body of Form (rūpa-kāya), 
one understands them (the maha-mandalas) as comprising the magical manifestation of shapes (vikurvāna) 
from the treasury of inexhaustible Body. The samaya-mandala is characterized by an arrangement of 
thunder-bolt (vajra), iron hook (ankusa), arrow (Sara), mgu ba, and so on, which are symbolizing agents 
for the way in which emancipation is comprehended; hence, comprises the magical manifestation of shapes 
from the arranged treasury of inexhaustible Mind. The dharma-cakra arranges and disposes the deities who 
stand for the practice which is the means of teaching how the Doctine (dharma) is comprehended; hence, 
is the blessing (adhisthāna) for the magical manifestation of shapes from the arranged treasury of inexhaust- 
ible Speech of all the Tathāgatas. Accordingly, in the case of the karma-mandala, it arrays the deities who 
are the offering and other rites; hence one should understand it as displaying in concise form the practice 
of all Tathāgatas for the aim of sentient beings." (Lessing/Wayman 1968:224 n.20).
"Accordingly to the Tattvaloka (Toh. 2510, by Anandagarbha), the correspondences between the four 
Families of the four sections and the four mudras are as follows; Body (kaya) and the maha-mudra, Mind 
(citta) and the samaya-mudra, Speech (väg) and the dharma-mudra, and Marvellous Action (karma) and 
the karma-mudra. Thus, the four sections and the four mudras are made to correspond in the given order.
"Moreover, the four mandalas and the four mudras correspond in the given order, because the four 
mandalas beginning with the maha-mandala lay stress on Body, Mind, Speech, and Marvellous Action in 
the given order. Those mean the Body, Mind, Speech, and Marvellous Action in the Families of Vairocana, 
Akṣobhya, Amitabha, and in the other two Families". (Lessing/Wayman 1968:225, mutatis mutandis).
The same position is put forth by Buddhaguhya in his commentary the Tantr-arthavatara: "This 
sequence emphasizes four types beginning with Body; for this reason one speaks of four mandalas. 
Nevertheless, it is not possible in general to have mind without a body, nor a voice without body and mind. 
Consequently, even in the various mandalas one must have the four portions, beginning with Body. 
Therefore, all the mandalas of the Families are here explained as having the signs of Body and so forth, 
and, in their proper order, the four mudra, the Mahamudra, and the samaya, dharma and karma mudras" 
(Lessing/Wayman 1968:227, mutatis mutandis).
Thus the six sub-mandalas of the Gobu-shingan are the six co-ordinates of the Tattva-sangraha method 
by which the yoga wheel of Dharma was set in motion. The position of the three primary commentators 
of India is summarised by Mkhas-grub-rje (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 214-249). Its in-depth comparison with 
the Gobu-shingan scroll will elucidate the course of the transmission of the Tantras to China, where a 
substantial measure was derived from the immensity of unwritten conventions and practices, as well as from

minora circulating around as handwritten manuals and persnal memoranda for ritual which opera
have dissappeared in the course of time.
The nine sub-mandalas of the Vajradhātu mandala can be divided into three groups:
I The six sub-mandalas of the Tattva-sangraha:
1.Vajradhātu-mahamandala, Karma-mandala, Jojin-ne
2. Samaya-mandala
3.Sūksma-mandala
Pūjā-mandala
5.Caturmudra-mandala
6.Ekamudra-mandala
II 7.Naya-mandala
III The two sub-mandalas of the second section of the Tattva-sangraha pertaining to Trailokyavijaya
8.Trailokyavijaya-karma-mandala 
9.Trailokyavijaya-samaya-mandala
Japnese scholars have debated the raison d'être of the nine mandalas on one painted scroii. While 
practical considerations guided the novenarian formulation of the Vajradhatu mandala, the philosophic 
basic for the concatenation is not clearly provided by the Sino-Japnese texts. It is only when we take into 
account the tibetan taxonomy and topical analysis of the tantras that the three groups I, II, III fall into a 
coherent picture. Mkhas-grub-rje (A.D. 1385-1438), the chief disciple of the great Tibetan teacher Tson- 
kha-pa, in his analysis of the fundamental of Buddhist tantras, systematises the yoga-tantra literature into 
(i) fundamental (mula) and (ii) explanatory (vyakhya) tantras. The explanatory tantras are divided into two 
explaining from the view points of (i) prajñā and (ii) upaya. Fifteen texts (Toh 479-493) and 161 
commentaries on them (Toh. 2501-2661) are classified under this scheme (Wayman 1973; 236-7). 
Here,below is a conspectus of the classification as it applies to the Sino-Japanese tantras:
Yoga Tantras
1 Mula tantra or fundamental tantra

(ii) Upaya (Tib. thabs)

From the above, it is clear that the composition of the Sino-Japanese 
the six-mandalas of the Tattvasangraha, the seventh sub-mandala represents the exegesis from the prajñā 
standpoint, and the eighth and ninth sub-mandalas betoken the upaya viewpoint. Thus this type of graphic 
mandala is all-embracing in its inclusion of the complete system of the fundamental text as well as both 
the explanatory perspectives of prajñā and upaya on a single scroll.
In the Tibetan cycle of 139 mandalus of the Tantra-samuccaya, the Tattva-sangraha is represented by 
two mandalas (Raghu Vira/Lokesh Chandra 1967:13.22, 23): (i) the 1037- deity Vajradhātu mandala of 
the Tathagata family as enunciated in the first part of the Tattva-sangr ha, and (ii) the 137 deity 
Trailokyavijaya mandala of the Vajra family as enunciated in a subsequent part of Tattva-sangraha.
expression in the Lamaist 
Furthermore, the Tattva-sangrala served as a basis for architectural 
areas. An architectural mandala or puramandala based on the Tattva-sangraha arose at Tabo soon after 
it was translated into Tibetan (Toh. 479) by Sraddhakaravarman and Rin-chenbzan-po (c 958-1055). 
The monastery at Tabo was founded to introduce the mandalas of the new system of our tantra. The Tabo 
(Tib. Ta-pho) monastery is situated on the north bank of the Spiti river in Himachal Pradesh. Life size 
stucco images of the deities of the Vajradhatumandala are set around the walls in a rectangular 
arrangement. This temple is a "complete three-dimensional mandala" (Snellgrove 1957: 185, 66-67). The 
layout of the deitics can be seen in G. Tucci's Indo-Tibetica (1935:3/1.26 fig. 2).
The earliest representation of the mandala of the Tattva-sangraha is in Indonesia as the monument of 
Chandi Sewu. Bosch (1929: 111-133) had identified it as early as 1929 as the mahamandala of our Tantra. 
designated as the Temple (chandi) of the Thousand (sewu). The Sewu is 
It had been appropriately 
an architectonic Vajradhātu-mahamandala whose niches are a sure guide to its iconography though 
all its stone and bronze statues have disappeared 'within the memory of man', including the central 
statue of Mahavairocana the fragments of whose head were discovered in 1927 (for a detailed discussion 
see Lokesh Chandra 1979:1-15). The central temple enshrined Vairocana, while the four surrounding 
cellas housed the other four Tathāgatas: Akṣobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amoghasiddhi 
and their niches the parivara deities of each of the Five Tathāgatas.
The 37 deities of the Vajradhātu mandala were represented as follows:
24Five Tathāgatas with their attendant deities
4puja-devis at the four corners of the buildings
8puja- and sangraha-devis in the medium chapel
(remains of five have been laid bare)

The four rows of 240 subsidiary chapels housed the Thousand Buddhas. Each of these chapels housed 
4 of the Thousand Buddhas, thus giving a total of 240 x 4 = 960 Buddhas. It suited the architectural 
requirements of every chapel that one of the Thousand Buddhas be placed in the centre and three others 
in the niches in the three walls, while the fourth side being the entrance-portal was empty. Bosch surmises 
that thousand means 'very many' and 240 could suffice for a Thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa; "the 
founder of the complex... erected 'merely' 240 sanctuaries for harbouring the Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa", 
This surmise is unnecessary. In our scheme, the total of 1000 was made up as follows:
36 deities in the central temple
4deities of Elements in the corners as in the Japanese mahamandala 
960 Thousand Buddhas
1000
In the Japanese mahamandala the four deities of the Elements, namely, Teja, Apaḥ, Vayu and Pṛthvi 
are situated in the four cornors (Esot. pl.464-467). These statues could have been placed in the corners 
of the enceinte under the open sky, or vestiges of lost chapels may be exhumed in future excavations. The 
expression Chandi Sewn can thus go back to ancient times, even to the eighth century (Fontein et al. 
1971:144 no.4) when the visualisation and construction of the gigantic ensemble took place
Another monumental stereomorphic representation of the Tattvasangraha, again on the soil of 
Java, was the world-renowned Borobudur (Lokesh Chandra 1979:1-68).
An astonishing evidence of the vogue of the Vajradhātu mandala of the Tattva-sangraha comes from 
Khotan2 in the Khotanese verses of Ca Kimä-śain. Prof. H.W. Bailey (1978: 53-56) has published the 
English translation of this poem, and has rightly characterised it as pertaining to Vajrayana, without 
defining its precise context. It is a eulogy of the sixteen deities of contemplation surrounding Vairocana 
in the mandala of the Tattva-sangraha. The 17 deities lauded are: 1 Vairocana, 4 Paramitas, 8 Puja-devis, 
and 4 Sangraha-devis. the complete mandala in the Japanese and Tibetan graphic traditions comprises 
37 main deities, corresponding to 37 categories (tattva) of the Tattva-sangraha "collection of categories" 
which are enumerated in its commentary by Padmavajra entitled Tantr-arth-avatāra-vyākhyāna (Toh. 
2502, Lessing/Wayman 1968:214 n.2). In the Khotanese poem, the four Tathāgatas (Akṣobhya, 
Ratnasambhava, Lokeśvara and Amoghasiddhi) have been left out along with the Sixteen Ma- 
habodhisattvas surrounding them.
After Arya-Vairocana, the Khotanese describes the Four Pāramitās (Khot. four dharmas), which are: 
Vajra-pāramitā (Jap.)=Mahā-pāramita (Khot.)
Ratna-pāramitā (Jap.)=Ratna-vajra (Khot.) 
Dharma-paramitā (Jap.)=Dharma-vajra (Khot.)
Karma-pāramitā (Jap.)= Karma-vajra-pāramitā (Khot).

195
A Comparative Study of the Tibetan, Japanese, Indonesian...
It may be noted that in Khotanese all are vajra-pāramitās, as can be deduced from the last term Karma- 
vajra-pāramitā. These Vajrayana-paramitās were distinguished from the other Mahayana Pāramitās, 
which are Jñana, Bala, Pranidhana, Upaya, Prajñā, Dāna, Sila, Kṣanti, Viryd, and Dhyand. (ii) The 
word 'Vajra' is short for vajra-pāramitā in Ratnavajra and Dharmavajra. (III) The Vajrapāramitā of the 
Sino-Japanese tradition sholuld have been Vajra-vajra-(pāramita) in conformity with the nomenclature 
of the other three, but to avoid tautology it was termed Mahaparamita, a new term which does not occur 
in the Mahāyāna pāramitās. (IV) This Khotanese nomenclature evidences the evolution of Vajrayana and 
its desire to have a terminology contradistinctive to Mahāyāna.
Prof. Bailey (p.53) observes: "In this text there are the Vajra-paramita and the Mahāpāramitā, 
together with the pāramitās identified with devata-deities". The Vajra-pāramitās is a generic designation 
for the Four Paramitas surrounding Arya-Vairocana, among whom Mahāpāramitā is the first. The earlier 
classical Six Paramitās are correlated to six of the Pūjā-devis.
The Eight Puja-devis are divided into: (i) four interior puja-devis and (ii) four exterior pūjā-devīs. 
The four interior ones are: Läsä/Läsyä, Mālā, Gītā and Nṛtya. The four exterior ones are: Puṣpā, Dhūpā, 
Alokā, Ganda (not in Khot.). In place of Gandha, we find Ajitä. This is an oversight. Ajita has no place 
in the Vajradhātu mahāhamandala. Ajita is one of the Four Apsaras Sisters in a special chapter devoted 
to them in the Adhyardhaśatika (T. 243). The prevalance of the Adhyardhaśatika in Khotan is attested 
by its Khotanese translation. Kim-san may have infused Ajita in the present eulogy in a moment of poetic 
confusion.
Four Sangraha-devis are Vajränkuśa, Vajra-pāśa, Vajra-sphota and Vajra-ghanta. Prof. Bailey 
translates sphota as 'bursting sound' (p.56) and connects her with Vajra-ghanta who is "active in sounds", 
thereby mixing up Vajra-sphota and Vajra-ghantā.
Prof. Bailey (p.56) makes an important observation regarding the Four Sangraha-devis: "For the names 
Vajra-kusa, Vajra-pāśā, Vajra-sphota and Vajra-ganda which are feminine, in spite of the masculine 
verbal form 28 hadaḍim 'he gathered' where the masculine pasa-may have decided the gender". It 
is significant that the concept of sangraha deities is reflected in the Khotanese verb hadadim, which 
is used in this context as a technical term. They correspond to the four attractive forces (catväri sangraha- 
vastuni) which are: dana 'alms', priyavadita 'sweet speech', arthacarya 'useful action', samanarthata 
'mutual aid'. Vajrankuśa and 'fi (p.412), Vajra-pāśa and 'si (p.416), Vajrasphota and tă (p.422) are 
both masculine and femine. Vajraghanta is feminine while the synonymous Vajravesa (p.406) is her 
masculine counterpart (aveśa=ghanta). Pages refer to Marine-Therèse de Mallmann, Introduction à 
l'conographie du Tantrisme bouddhique, Paris, 1976.
There are six classical pāramitās; dana, sila, kṣānti, virya, dhyana, and prajñā. These are correlated 
to six of the eight puja-devis of the Vajradhatu mahamandala as follows:

Lokesh Chandra
LäsyäDana-pāramitā
MālāŚila-pāramitā
Gitā
Ksānti-pāramitā
NṛtyāVirya-pāramitā
PuspaDhyana-pāramitā
DhupāPrajñā-pāramitā
To these six pāramitās, four more are added to make up ten pāramitās; jñāna, bala, pranidhāna 
and upaya. Of them Jñara-pāramitā is mentioned alone on p.55 line 21. It is followed by Ajita. Both 
of them are out of context.
Buddhaic light (adj. to both Buddha and to bodhi) should be abhisambodhi. So also on p.55 line 
21 pure right bodhi (bvāma), line 31 Buddhaic bodhi (bvāmi) stand for abhisambodhi.
The above succinct structural definition of the eulogy necessitates a re-paragraphing of the English 
translation of the Khotanese poem. The first paragraph pertaining to Arya-Vairocana can end at: "(nem 
followed by numeral 1)".
The second paragraph begins on line 24 with "by the fourfold act ...", introducing in general the 16 
deities "who guide on the 16 paths".
The third paragraph specifying Mahāpāramitā commences on line 29 with "for the reeason...".
The paragraph on Dharma-vajra should commence on p.54 line 36: "right, great ...".
The paragraph of Vajraloka (page 55 line 16) should commence with "who in the forest of..."
The alinea of Vajra-ghanta (page 56 line 2) should commence with "who indeed is one having 
all sounds..."
The poem of Kim-san is a clear proof of the propularity of the yoga-tantras in Khotan whose prime 
expression was the Vajradhātu mahamandala based on the mula-tantra Tattva-sangraha.
The Khotanese poem on the mahamandala can be represensed graphically as follows in the light 
of the Japanese depiction (the Japanese iconography can be seen in Esot., nos. 406ff.):

"After verse 12 Vajrālokā there is the verse 13 on Ajita: no trace of Vajragandha". (Prof. Bailey in 
a letter). From verse 12 pertaining to the 12th Vajrälokā it is clear that each deity has one verse. Thus 
the verse numbers agree with the consecutive numbering of the deities. Prof. Bailey informs me in a 
letter: "The number of the verses are given 1 (omitting 2, 3, 4, 5), 6 (omitting 7), 8, 9 (omitting 10, 11, 
12, 13), 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and no further numbering".

We may conclude the foregoing preliminary observations by a simple statement that, the Tattva- 
sangraha represents a syndrome of philosophy, ritual, art and architecture, of several regions of Classical 
Asia in a shared cultural interdependence of values and forms. The clarity and precision of the Sanskrit 
text will provide a new starting point for the in-depth study of the mainfold strands, though knit together 
in integral unity, lie dispersed far apart. It will illumine many facets of the cultural history of many 
countries.
Notes
1. The Tattva-sangraha is known by several names: Ṛta-samhara, Yoga-sangraha, Vajrasekhara-tantra. 
Rta-samhara has been discussed above. The term Yoga-sangraha. (Jap. Yuga-shuyo, Chin Yü-ch'ieh 
chi-yao) occurs in the text on 'Jvälämukhi-preti-bali-vidhi from the Yoga-sangraha' (Nj. 1467, T. 
1320) translated by Amoghavajra during A.D. 746-771. Herein Yoga-sangraha refers to the Tattva- 
sangraha as the fundamental text of yoga-tantras. In Japan the most common appellation of our tantra 
is Kongōchō-kyō=Vajrasekhara-sutra. It has to be clearly distinguished from the explanatory tantra 
Vajrasekhara of the Tibetan Canon (Toh. 480) which is a different text. In the Sino-Japanese tradition 
the term yoga, Vajrasekhara and Vajrasekhara-yoga are generic terms refering to the yoga-tantras in 
general and thus the Vajrasekhara-sutra denoted the Tattva-sangraha.
2. "It is interesting to know that a Buddhist text from Khotan has value, apart from the language (which 
is, of course, my approach)", Prof. Bailey.

Pigeaud translates it as follows:
Also in Sagala is a pratiṣṭhā (divine abode), a Jina likeness, infinite in splendour, 
naturally an Ardhanareshwari, with her, the honoured Illustrious Bajradewi,
united,
His honoured associate as to increase in the world, one in kriya (rites) and brata
(observances).
The Holy Wairocana-Locana wasTheir aspect, being one arca (cult-statue),
celebrated in the realm.
The above translation is not clear. The poet says that at Sakgala a Buddhist 
statue was established of excellent splendour. Krtanagara was united with his 
Queen Bajradevi in the same statue, it was virtually a statue of Ardhanariśvara 
(right half Śiva, left half Parvati). The two together brought prosperity to the 
land, being one in rites and observances. It was Vairocana-Locana, a conjoint 
image, and was worshipped by the people.
The yab-yum image of Krtanagara-Bajradevi was Ardhanariśvara as well as 
Vairocana-Locanā. It must have shared Śaiva and Buddhist characteristics at the 
same time and it enlightened (prakasa) the subjects of the realm in a unity (eka) of 
both the denominations. The name of the city Sakala also has a syncretic signifi- 
cance: it is a city in the Mahabharata as well as in Buddhist texts. In Old 
Javanese texts, the consort of Vairocana is Vajradhātviśvari, and the consort of 
Akṣobhya is Locanā. Dhātviśvari and Locanã are also equated in the San Hyan 
Kamahāyānikan p. 68: Dhatvisvari Locanekat Locana is originally Rocana, 
feminine of Rocana who is the main deity of the Avataṁsakā sūtras, and later 
evolved as the Abhisambodhi Vairocana (called Vairocana of the Garbha-maṇḍala 
in Japanese Mantrayana). The name Rocana is known in Chinese and from the 
Sanskrit Gaṇḍavyuha. It has been mistranslated by modern scholars as Vairocana. 
This has led to several misunderstandings, including the interpretation of Locanā. 
This is to clarify the doubts raised by Pigeaud in his notes (1962: 4. 133).
The tantric cult practised by Krtanagara pertained to mahāyoga-tantras 
represented by Guhyasamaja whose main deity is six-armed Akṣobhya, termed 
Mahākṣobhya in the Jaka Dolog inscription in contradistinction to the two-armed 
Akṣobhya in bhumi-sparśa mudrā. Gaṇacakra is a general tantric term and is not 
related exclusively to any specific tantric system, like that of Hevajra.
Nihom's paper invites a detailed consideration of Vajrayana data in Old 
Javanese texts, inscriptions, sculptures, paintings and linguistic survivals (like 
Erucakra) in modern Javanese.

conspectus of the Mongolian Tanjur
By LOKESH CHANDRA (NEW DELHI)
1. In the Band XXIV of this very Jahrbücher WALTHER HEISSIG gave a list 
of the exemplars of the Mongolian Tanjur that were known to exist in Mongolia, 
China and Japan. Most of them were in Inner Mongolia. Since then conditions 
have changed and the monasteries of Inner Mongolia have been subject to revolu- 
tionary upheaval: the exact fate of the monastic libraries is unknown. Heissig 
refers to eight mostly complete copies of the Mongolian Tanjur in the Wang-ye-fu 
in the Qaratsin-Gebiet (Wang Banner), Chi-ning-szu Monastery, I-hua-szu Monas- 
tery, Ch'ien-te-mu-ni miao, Yuan-chüeh-szu Monastery, Ku-la-ha-chi miao, Hui- 
ning-szu Monastery, and Chi-ching-szu Monastery.
According to the latest information kindly conveyed to me by Prof. Lubsan- 
vandan some copies of the Mongol Canon have reached the research libraries in 
Hohehot (Köke Qoto) the present capital of Inner Mongolia. For example in the 
Institute for Mongol Language and History at Hohehot there is a complete copy 
of the Tanjur and three Kanjurs. Again in the National Library of Hohehot there 
is a complete set of the Mongol Kanjur and as well as of the Tanjur. In the Uni- 
versity of Hohehot there are two copies of the Mongol Kanjur, one in the general 
library and another in the Seminar. It will be interesting to note that in the 
Institute for Mongol Language and History there are some volumes of the Ligdan 
Khan Kanjur¹.
2. Following the plan adopted by LOUIS LIGETI in his "Catalogue du Kanjur 
Mongol imprimé" (Budapest 1942), the eminent Mongol scholar RINCHEN has been 
busy on the preparation of a descriptive catalogue of the Mongolian Tanjur. This 
catalogue is ready in the Mongolian script. It runs into 1729 pages of foolscap size, 
which are now in the possession of RAGHU VIRA in five bound volumes. The entire 
catalogue will be printed in romanisation by the International Academy of Indian 
Culture, in its Satapitaka Series. On the reverse of one of its pages, on the basis of 
oral tradition it is annotated that the Mongol Tanjur was based on the Derge 
edition of the Tibetan Tanjur. The Tibetan Tanjur of Derge has been rightly held 
in the greatest respect for its accuracy by the learned monks of the lamaistic world 
and the aforesaid oral tradition in respect of the Mongol Tanjur seems to be just a 
reflection of the general esteem. A comparison of the arrangement of the volumes 
in the Mongol Tanjur clearly points to the Peking Red Tanjur of Tibetan as the 
basis. The Mongol Tanjur has the same system of dividing as the Tibetan: the first 
division is the Bstod-tshogs (the stotras or Odes), followed by the Rgyud-hgrel
1 UAJb XXIV (1952) 122-123 and 130.

A conspectus of the Mongolian Tanjur
37
(commentaries on the Tantras) and the Mdo-hgrel (commentaries on the Sūtras). 
Each division is numbered by letters of the Tibetan alphabet in both the languages: 
the Stotras are contained in 1 volume, the Tantra-commentaries in 87 volumes and 
the Sutra-commentaries in 136 volumes. In Tibetan, pothi Tsha (18) of the Rgyud- 
hgrel is split up into two volumes: the Mongol version too follows suit in having 
Tsha in two volumes. Another astonishing correspondence is that the text or texts 
included in the various volumes tallies exactly in both the Tanjurs. For instance 
volume Gi of the Tantra (serial no. 35) begins with Pindikṛtasadhana and ends 
with Sraddhapralapa nama stava in both the languages. All facts point to the 
complete dependence of the Mongol on the Peking Red version in Tibetan.
3. In Zur technischen Durchführung der mongolischen Tandjur Übersetzung (UAJb 
XXVII 222-234) W. HEISSIG gave an idea of the 43 volumes deposited in the Kyoto 
University of Japan. The complete set of the Mongolian Tanjur in the State 
Library, Ulanbator was known to him, just through the Catalogue of the 
Library, Ulus-un nom-un sang-un ači-yin anggi-dur büküi mongyol anggi-dur bičimel 
ba darumal nom bicig üd-ün büridkel. In 1955 RAGHU VIRA and in 1957 the author 
had the privilege of visiting Ulanbator and seeing the Mongol Tanjur which was 
then lying in the general reading-room of the State Library in the Committee of 
Sciences. Hereunder follows a conspectus of all the 2261 volumes of the Tanjur in 
Ulanbator. References to Rinchen's manuscript catalogue mentioned above, are 
followed by references to P. CORDIER, Catalogue du fonds tibétain, parts 2,3 (Paris 
1909, 1915) to indicate the texts included in each volume of the Mongol Tanjur 
till its full-fledged catalogue is published.

1 The sets of the Mongolian Tanjur in the I-hua-szu and Ch'ien-te-mu-ni miao consisted 
of 227 (sic) volumes according to W. HEISSIG, UAJb XXIV (1952) 123 and 130. The 227th 
volume must have been the Surangama-samadhi-sūtra of 1763 A.D. (Ch'ien-lung's 
year 28). It is of the same format as the Tanjur and is sometimes found along with the sets 
of the Canon. It consists of the cover-folio +5+182+ the final cover folio with the illustra- 
tions of the four Lokapālas. Its marginal signature on the left is Ni Eldeb Usnir Bayatur-a 
yabuyči and on the right it is in Chinese. This edition has not been noticed 
earlier. Cf. L. LIGETI, Catalogue du Kanjur mongol imprimé, no. 889.

CONTENTS OF TWO CLASSICAL HIPPOLOGICAL
TREATISES
LOKESH CHANDRA
International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi
In 1957 during an expedition to the Mongolian Peoples' Republic 
we had the pleasure of meeting several traditional and modern 
scholars who had a deep knowledge of their cultural and civilisational 
heritage, besides a rich recollection of the oral traditions which are 
fast disappearing but afford clues to unsolved problems. During a 
conversation I was told that Sum pa mkhan po Ye ses dpal hbyor 
the versatile polymath had written a horse-treatise.On returning
to India I looked into the opera omnia of this celebrated historian 
ond to my surprise it appeared in the supplementary pothi, side- 
captioned as KHA. From the very title it is apparent that the work 
is styled on the Classical tradition. For its full appreciation it is 
necessary to survey the contents of the only Classical text contained 
in the Tibetan Tanjur in pothi DO of the Sutra division (Cordier 
III.500). The full title in Tibetan is Rtahi tshehi rig byed sa li ho 
tras bsdus pa which is a translation of the Sanskrit Salihotriyāśvā- 
yurvedasamhita, that is an opus on horse medicine by Salihotra the 
great sage (dran sron chen po) of India who first wrote on this branch 
of veterinary science. Salihotra, the son of Hayaghosa (Rta skad), 
propounded it to his disciple-son Suśruta (Legs thos) whose samhita 
on human surgery has earned him a pre-eminent position in medical 
history. The hippological treatise is translated from Sanskrit 
which was in the indravajra metre and was divided into 8 sections 
(Tib. gnas Skt. sthana) like Indian medicine in general The

2
sections were subdivided into 192 chapters (Tib. leḥu=Skt. 
adhyaya). Unfortunately all the 8 sections are not extant. Only 3
sections exist, the first and the last two:
Section

Chapters
1Sutra-sthana (mdo yi gnas) 40
7
Siddhi-sthāna (grub pahi gnas)14
8
Rahasya-sthana (gsan bahi gnas)23
While the translation of the Sanskrit original into Tibetan was done 
by the imperial command of Bkra sis lha lde btsan, it is available 
today in the form it was revised by the Great Translator (zhu chen
gyi lotsaba chen) Rin chen bzań po.
The contents of the three sections are indicated below with 
some correspondences in printed Sanskrit works:

The above text is longer than all the three printed Sanskrit 
hippological works; namely, Asvavaidyaka of Jayadatta, Asvasastra 
of Nakula and Salihotra of Bhoja. It seems that the Tanjur Salihotra 
must have been an extensive and comprehensive treatise on 
horses in its day and its full text was a rarety even then. While 
the first section informs us about horses in all their aspects, the last 
two sections are strictly medical in character and go into great 
detail. The Tibetan text was transmitted to the Mongols in a 
Mongolian translation by Ye ses bkra sis of Left Sönid.
In the eighteenth century, the prolific writer Sum mkhan 
pa po
Ye ses dpal dbyor, celebrated as a historian by his Dpag-bsam-ljon- 
bzans, wrote a short treatise on the examination of horses entitled 
Rgya gar pahi lugs bstun rta dpyad dpal yyan zhes bya ba, which 
occurs at the end of the supplementary volume (lhan thabs) of his 
collected works printed at Hohehot, Inner Mongolia. The entire 
text is in 70 verses, which have been serially numbered for con- 
venient reference though there is no numeration in the original 
xylograph. The sections are indicated in the xylograph by the
sign
The title makes it clear that the examination of horses is accor- 
ding to the Indian method. After a homage to Vaiśravaṇa, imme- 
diately follow synonyms of the horse which are different from 
those in the classical lexicon Amarakośa, except myur hgro= 
turaga, hgros legs sadhuvahin (st. 1,2). In st. 4 ff. the horses 
are classified according to the dominance of the three humors 
5Dpag-bsam-ljon-bzan, ed. Lokesh Chandra, p. xiii ff., gives his bio- 
graphic details.

8
phlegm, bile and wind (cf. Jay. p. 76, Bho. p. 9). In stanza 
9 
the horses are alternately classed into the four castes,
namely: brāhmaṇa, ksatriya, vaisyaand sudra (cf. I.8 of
Sal.). Stanza 10 commences anew section dealing with the 
different limbs (Cf. Śal. I.9). St. 23gives the characteristics of a
mare. Stanza 24 starts a new section on the colors of horses (cf. 
Sal. I.18). The next section commences with st. 30 and deals with 
marks on the forehead (cf. Śal. I.19). The following sections give 
the inauspicious (nan: st. 37), auspicious (sis: st. 39), low (dman: st. 
42), and very auspicious (sin tu sis: st. 43) characteristics. St. 49 
deals with the defects of horses (cf. Šal. I.35). The section starting
with st. 56 defines the measurements of the body of a horse (cf. 
Sal. I.11 and 1.14). In the concluding stanza 58 of the section the 
dimensions are specified in figures for metric economy. Stanza 61
begins the section on the age of horses (cf. Sal. I.27), followed by a 
section on their span of life as in the Sal. I.28. Here too, the span
of life is not expressed in words but in figures to promote metric 
brevity. The final section pertains to the food of horses (cf. Śal. I. 
15). The medical treatment of horses is not considered at all.
The text of Sum pa mkhan po is almost inaccessible. It is re- 
produced in the following pages for further research into hippologies 
written in the Tibetan and Mongolian languages. The present note 
is to stimulate studies on the horsemanship of the Mongols, among 
whom the animal commands reverence and affection besides being 
an important factor in their rise as a world power of the ancient 
world.
Sal. is short for the Salihotra of the Tanjur.

-CULTURAL CONTACTS OF INDONESIA AND SRI LANKA IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY
AND THEIR BEARI NG ON THE BARABUDUR

CULTURAL CONTACTS OF INDONESIA AND SRI LANKA IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY 
AND THEIR BEARING ON THE BARABUDUR
1.
Prof. J.G. de Casparis (1961) has written a fascinating 
paper on the 'New Evidence on Cultural Relations between Java and 
Ceylon in Ancient Times' based on the Ratubaka Inscription in Pre- 
nagari, dated Saka 714-A.D.792/3. The 12th strophe of the
inscription reads:
ayam-iha jinasunoḥ padmapāneh kṛpaloḥ
prathita uu -----upādaiḥ
Jina-vara-vinayoktaiḥ śikṣitānāṁ ya/tinām=
abhayagiri-vihāraḥ kāritah simhalanam
Casparis (1961:242) raises a doubt about its syntactic interconnections: 
"The instrumental case of what is probably a compound ending in 
O padaiḥ could be an attribute to Jinavaravinayoktaiḥ but it is 
difficult to see how any of the meanings of pada could be applied to 
the words of the Buddha. It is therefore more likely that the 
instrumental depends on karitaḥ, an epithet referring to those who 
had the vihara built" The prose order of the strophe would be: 
ayam iha prathita...padaiḥ Jinavaravinayoktaiḥ śiksitanam sinhalānām 
yatinam krte/ krpāloḥ Jinasunoḥ Padmapāneh Abhayagiri-vihāraḥ 
kāritaḥ. It means: "Here this Abhayagiri monastery consecrated to 
Jinasūnu Padmapāņi the Compassionate has been constructed for the 
sake of Simhala monks who have been trained in the Vinaya of the 
Buddha (Jinavara) as enunciated (ukta) by the celebrated (prathita) 
Venerable (pada) 
(name lost in the lacuna of ten 
syllables). This is a crucial strophe for the 
Indonesia, and merits consideration at length. 
emphasised in this stanza, which were distinctive characteristics of 
the Abhayagiri-vāsins: (1) The Indonesian monastery was dedicated to 
Padmapani in his Mahakarunika aspect, who must have been predominant

merit special mention of the teacher who initiated the changes and 
whose name is unfortunately lost though the traces of four aksaras 
on fragment e may preserve the name of the founder of the Abhayagiri 
school, namely Dhammaruci (Zeyst 1961;28). The differences between 
the orthodox Mahavihara and the Abhayagiri vihara were doctrinal and 
mainly on account of Vinaya rules. According to the Mahavamsa 
33.95 Mahatissa was expelled from the Mahavihara on account of his 
frequenting lay families. At the instance of Sanghamitta of 
Abhayagiri, king Mahasena withdrew royal support from the Mahavihāra 
as their monks did not teach the correct Vinaya. "It is noteworthy 
that no accusation of heretical doctrine was professed. Soon it 
became impossible for the monks to continue to live in the Mahavihara, 
and after it had been deserted for nine years, its building material 
was removed to enrich the Abhayagirivihāra". Some three hundred and 
sixty four colleges and great temples were uprooted and destroyed, 
says an ancient chronicle; and the spoils gathered from them went to 
enrich and adorn the home of heresy, the Abhayagiri, which, now 
splendid in ornaments and rich in possessions, stood pre-eminent over 
all as the greatest and wealthiest monastery in Lanka" (Zeyst 1961:26)
The Abhayagiri monks rejected Parivara the fifth book of the Vinaya, 
and in this connection it should be borne in mind that the Mahayana 
canon divides the Vinaya into four and not five parts (Zeyst 1961:28).
2. Padmapāņi is Avalokitesvara, whose name appears earlier in 
line 7 of the inscription as Kamalapāņi. Sarkar (1971:48v) has not 
recognized this word as a synonym of Avalokitesvara and has trans- 
lated it in a general way "having lotus-like palm", while it means 
"he who holds the lotus in his hand". Later on Padmapāņi is rendered 
by Sarkar as "Lord with his lotus-feet" (sic!). The epithet krpaloh 
is equivalent to Karunika or Mahākāruṇika which are synonymous
*Malalasekera (1938) gives a succinct and detailed account of 
the events leading to the heterodoxy of Abhayagiri (1.130), adoption 
of Vetullavāda by them (2.918) and its prevalence among them as 
Dhammarucikas (1.1147-48).

with Avalokitesvara.
3. The Abhayagiri-vasins were adherents of Vetullavada as 
is well known from the Sinhalese chronicles DIpavamsa and Mahāvamsa 
and the commentary on the Kathavatthu. The reading vaitulya is found 
in place of vai pulya in the Kashgar manuscript of the Saddharma- 
pundarika-sutra. 
The vulgate title Saddharma-pundarika dharma- 
paryaya is Saddharma-pundarika Maharatna Vaitulya-sutra in the 
Kashgar manuscript and in one occurence the reading is vaitupulya 
(Kern 1907:3.99), a clear indication of the transition from vaitulya to 
vai pulya. Thus the Saddharma-pundarika (SP.) was an important sutra 
of the Vaitulyakas, and as such a scripture of the Abhayagiri-vasins. 
This is confirmed by the fact that they had a monastery dedicated to 
Padmapani in Indonesia. The 24th chapter of the Saddharma-pundarika 
is a description of the miracles of Avalokitesvara (Avalokitesvara- 
vikurvana-nirdeśa). In Japan, this chapter is treated as an 
independent sutra and bears the title Kannon-gyo 'Avalokitesvara- 
sūtra'. It is recited daily by Japanese devotees to ward off evils 
and calamities. Avalokitesvara has vowed to save all beings in His 
infinite compassion, where He is known as Daihi-shoja or Mahakaruņika- 
muni. 
The SP. says that if a ship sailing on the ocean be cast 
on the Rakṣasi-dvi pa and if in that ship a single being implores 
Avalokitesvara all will be saved. In the Karandavyuha devoted to the 
glorification of Avalokitesvara, the nakṣasi-dvī pa is identified 
with Srilanka (Kern 1909:407, n.1): an ancient link between 
Avalokitesvara and Srilanka.
4. The sustained patronage of Sinhalese kings to Abhayagiri 
must have stemmed from their deep belief in the miraculous protective 
powers of the SP. (Visser 1935:2.621). The state is in constant need 
of stability and security: and this could be accomplished by the SP. 
Theravada had no royal ceremonies: either for the consecration or 
well-being of the king, or for the stability of the State. Hence 
recourse to other sutras. The royal preceptors to the Thai King, 
inspite of his being a follower of Theravada, are Saiva priests who 
discharge ritual functions of State to this day. In Japan, from

5
olden times this king of sutras has been worshipped together with 
the Kāruṇikarāja-sūtra (Ninnōkyo) and Suvarnaprabhāsa-sūtra 
(Saishōōkyo) as "wonderful texts protecting the state" (Jap. chingo 
kokka no myōten) by all the sects (Visser 1935:2.702). During the 
early years of the advent of Buddhism prince Shotoku completed a 
commentary on the SP. in A.D. 615 (ibid. 622). The blessing power 
of the SP. was invoked by its recitation and making images of 
Avalokitesvara not only to secure recovery of imperial personages 
from illness, but also to suppress rebellion in order to afford 
peace to the people (ibid. 640). This sutra was studied and vene-
rated as a "text of the utmost importance and blessing power" 
(ibid.677). In A.D.836 the Japanese Emperor Nimmyō issued an 
ordinance stating that the protective power of the SP. was such 
that it turned misfortune into felicity (ibid.655).
5. Avalokitesvara images in Srilanka. From the 6-7th 
century onwards upto the present day the worship of Avalokitesvara 
has been popular in Srilanka. Statuettes of him belonging to the 
6-7th century, are at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and from 
Elahera. The most remarkable of Sinhalese statues of Avalokitesvara 
for its height and proportions, with an Ami tabha in his headdress, is 
the one found at Buduruvegala, whose details are finished in stucco. 
The sunken relief rock sculpture of Avalokitesvara at Weligama 
(Southern province), the ten-foot high Dambulla Avalokitesvara in 
the cave shrine of the eighth century, the Situlpavva granite 
statue of the 7-8th century, Ambalantota head in limestone, and 
metallic images attest the widespread worship of Avalokitesvara in 
Srilanka. Culavamsa refers to the worship of Avalokitesvara in the 
reign of Parakramabahu II (1234-1269). The renowned scholar
Sri Rahula of the Totagamu vihara who lived during the reign of 
Parakramabahu VI (1415-1467) was a devotee of Natha Avalokitesvara. 
The veneration of Avalokitesvara during the reign of Kirtiśrīrāya- 
simha (1747-1782) is referred to by the Culavamsa. To this day, 
worship of Avalokitesvara continues at the Natha-devale at Kandy and 
Lokesvara-Natha-devale at Wegiriya (Mudiyanse 1967:8,38,11,10).

6. Hsüan-tsang (Watters 1905: 2.335) halted for some time 
at Kanchi in A.D.640 in the hope of visiting Srilanka. Prior to 
his departure the king of Simhala died and the country was in dis- 
order so much so that three hundred monks left the country and 
arrived at Kanchi. It cannot be ruled out that in course of this 
exodus some of them migrated to Indonesia, stayed on and established 
themselves there. In times to come, in A. D.792/3, an Abhayagiri 
vihara was constructed for their denomination. Prof. de Casparis 
says: "The epithets referring to the high standard of learning of 
the Sinhalese need not imply more than the conventional kind of 
praise. It is, however, possible that they were added in order to 
impress upon the Javanese monks that the Abhayagiri Vihara, of 
which not many Javanese might have heard, was not just an ordinary 
monastery but a place that enjoyed great prestige in the Buddhist 
World". It should be noted that Amoghavajra had travelled from 
Central Asia for his initiation in Srilanka, sailed to Indonesia 
where he met his would-be teacher Vajrabodhi in A.D.718. Vajrabodh: 
landed at Canton in A.D.719. A year later Amoghavajra arrived at 
Loyang in A.D.720. He worked with Vajrabodhi in China, and on his 
teacher's death he left China in 741 for Srilanka and South India 
to acquire new tantra literature, and in A.D.746 king STlamegha of 
Srilanka sent through him letters and presents to the emperor of 
China (Chou 1945:284-307). This is a clear indication that lines 
of communication between Central Asia, South India, Srilanka, 
Indonesia and China were open and the sea route was frequented both 
for trade and culture. Amoghavajra may have been initiated at the 
Abhayagiri monastery itself The probability is that the Indonesians 
were fully aware of the renown and glory of Abhayagiri of Simhala. 
It was the monastery where Chinese scholars collected Sanskrit texts 
of the vinaya and tantras. The cultural interflow between Srilanka 
and Indonesia was brisk and lively as late as the fifteenth century 
when a manuscript of the poem Janakiharaṇa was procured from 
Indonesia by king Parakramabahu VI 01 Kotte (1410-1465). The author 
(Lokesh Chandra 1979) has identified the 28 stanzas of the first 
canto of this work in the Indonesian palmleaf manuscript or cake pan

7
preserved at the Leiden University Library Cod. Or.5089, which 
affirms the presence of Janakiharana in Indonesia,
7. Besides strophe 12, Prof. de Casparis (1979) has 
deciphered and translated the first three invocatory stanzas of 
this inscription from Ratubaka and tried to link them with the 
Barabudur.

I pay homage to Sambuddha who is verily the Sumeru,

I pay homage to Him who is the fire of noble Dharma, 
who shines forth quashing the prevailing beliefs of 
outstanding heretics, struck by whose majesty the 
heretics [strong like bulls panic away in fright,
who in an instant reduces to ashes the numerous 
attachments to heresy and who burns out all bondages.

I pay obeisance to the Ocean of Supreme Virtues whose 
nakras and makaras are the thousands of disciples (of 
the first seven stages) and the arhats (aśaiksa, the 
eighth stage), who is Voidness (sunyata) and cause- 
lessness (animitta), whose only essence (rasa) is 
complete liberation, whose is a great mine of jewels: 
his wise words, whose conscientiousness (hr) are like 
the splashing waters (hrada, [of the ocean]), nourished- 
and-invigorated (samapyayita) by the rushing flow of 
excellent rivers which are deliberations on esoteric 
concerns; bounded (vaddha) by clean (amala) shores 
(vela) which are immaculate (amala) discipline and 
worship.
8. The first stanza compares the Perfectly Enlightened 
One (Sambuddha) to Sumeru which cannot be shaken by raging storms. 
The components of the montane environs are correlated to the Buddha:
SumeruSamBuddha
deep caves (guha)profound wisdom (dhi) 
rocks (sila)lofty traditions (smrti) 
shining metals (dhātu)Good Words (sadvākya) 
cascades (prasravana) Love (maitri)
forests (vana)
meditation (samadhi)
valleys (kandara)few desires (alpecchata) 
violent tempests (ugra pavana)eight ways of the world 
(asta loka-dharma)
Dhi-gambhira-guho is treated by Casparis as 'whose profound caves 
are knowledge' which may better be rendered as 'whose deep caves 
are profound wisdom': gambhira meaning both deep and profound,

9
implying physical depth and spiritual profundity. sadvakya 
dhatujjvalo is translated by Casparis as 'whose brilliance is 
owing to its relic: the Good Word', dhatu does not refer to relics 
but to the precious metals like gold, silver, sapphire and amber 
that adorn the Sumeru mountain:
"he must imagine an earth surface (*bhumitala)
made of many jewels and strewn with gold sand. He 
blesses it with the formula, Om cala vi/ra/ hum svaha.
Upon it he imagines an ocean of milk, free from 
such a fault as fish-gills, adorned with such flowers 
as the red lotus (padma) and the blue lotus (utpala), 
and over which soar flocks of bejewelled birds. He 
blesses it with the formula, Om vimala dhaha hum.
In the middle of this ocean, he imagines a four- 
sided Sumeru mountain, adorned on all four sides with 
rows of stairs made respectively of gold, silver, 
sapphire (indranila), and amber, all over which spring 
up wish-granting trees (kalpa-vrksa) decorated with a 
thousand fluttering victory banners. He imagines rising 
above those to a height of many yojanas a lotus trunk 
which takes its origin from a shaft in the center of 
Mount Sumeru, is graced with many jewels, has leaves 
made of variegated jewels and blossoms whose filaments 
are of gold, anthers of amber, and tops of pistils 
ringed by lines of silver" (Lessing/Wayman 1968:175).
kandara is translated by Casparis as 'Mount' but it means a narrow 
valley, glen (MW): kam jalena diryate iti kandara 'that which is 
cut across by water': the narrow valleys are counterbalanced by 
few desires. Casparis reads aṣtabhira (2) dhi wherein the dubious 
adhi has to be corrected to api which supplies the requisite 
emphasis. Casparis translates the third quarter as which is not 
shaken by the eight horrible winds: the worldly qualities': horrible 
winds should be violent winds and eight does not refer to them but

10
to lokadharma, which are enumerated in the Dharmasangraha 61: 
astau lokadharmah/labhah, alabhaḥ, sukham, duhkham, yaśaḥ, 
ayasah, ninda, prasamsa ceti. These eight are alsò enumerated in 
Pali texts (DIghanikaya, Anguttaranikaya, Culla-ni ddesa, Pați sambhida- 
magga, Vibhanga, etc., PTSD). This is a common epithet: anupalipto 
lokadharmaih (Mvy.873, LV.352.10) 'not defiled by the ways of the 
world', astalokadharmanupalipta in Lalitavistara 275.5, sikṣasamuccaa 
180.2. Sambuddha-sumerum is translated as a genetive tatpurusa 
compound 'the Sumeru of the Buddhas' by Casparis, while the Buddha 
and Sumeru are in apposition: the Sumeru-like Buddha.
9. Now let us take up the second stanza. Casparis reads 
the first quarter as: Lokair=/va/rṣṣadhara-pravahi-samayan akramya 
yo dipyate, and translates it as 'which burns after having grasped 
the tides (of the ocean), which 
...(?)'. The reading has to
be emended to loke carssivarao. It refers to the Buddha who 
vanquishes the might of the prevailing doctrines, carries the day 
and shines with the newly won laurels.DI pyate is 'burns' in the 
case of fire, and 'shines forth' in the context of the Buddha. 
Casparis translates the second quarter as "by whose majesty the 
heretic bulls, excited, approach without fear". It is contrary to 
the general tenor of the stanza wherein the Buddha vanquishes the 
mightiest of heretics who vanish away in fright; vitrastaḥ is 
'frightened, alarmed, terrified' (MW): vi is intensive and not 
privative (as taken by Casparis: 'without fear'). Pratiyanti is 
not 'approach' but 'go away' or run away in panic. uddhata in the 
present context means struck out, pushed out, thrown away, uprooted. 
In the third quarter Casparis reads nana-drsti /vi/sanka where 
visanka is doubtful. The word drsti 'view, opinion', is "rarely in 
a good sense, it is as in Pali, almost always wrong opinion, heresy" 
(Edgerton 1953:269) Five drstis are enumerated in the Dharma- 
sangraha 68, Mahavyutpatti 1955-59: satkaya-drsti, antagraha-drati, 
mithya-drsti, drsti-paramarsa, sila-paramarsa. Drsti-paramarśa, 
'clinging or attachment to heresy' is paraphrased by the Abhi- 
dharmakosa v.15,18 as hinocca-d 'regarding as high what is low' 
(Edgerton 1953:269-270). The metre requires three syllables and

11
so it cannot have paramarsa which comprises four syllables. It has 
to be substituted by vimarśa which would also alliterate with the 
next word vrndam. Thus the conjectural visanka 'considerations' 
which does not fit into the context can be replaced by vimarsa in 
the meaning of paramarsa 'clinging to, attachment to ... (in a 
disapproved way) and we have a powerful and eloquent statement of 
the intentions of the author of the inscription. In the fourth 
quarter the word anu (4)[niba/ndha is not quite clear. Edgerton 
does not give this word, but vini bandha 'bondage, attachment' is 
cited from Mahāvyutpatti 2199, 7232 and the Dasabhumika 51.14,15. 
The five bondages of the mind (cetaso vini bandha) are frequently 
enumerated in Pali texts: DIghanikaya 3.238, Majjhimanikaya 1.103, 
Anguttaranikaya 3.249, 4.461, 5.17, Vibhanga 477.
10. The third stanza commences with: saiksasaiksa-sahasra- 
cakra-makaro, translated by Casparis as 'whose makaras are the 
multitude of those who are in training and those who are beyond 
training 
sat sa and asaiksa are technical terms. Saiksa is a 
disciple undergoing training in the first seven stages of religious 
discipline, while aśaiksa is the eighth stage of the arhat who no 
longer needs training (Edgerton 1953:80). cakra (Edgerton 1953:221a) 
is one of the four states of (desirable, happy) existence (in which 
gods and men may find themselves) enumerated in the Mahāvyut patti 
1603-7 in the chapter on catvari deva-manusyanam cakrani. Similarly 
in Pali Anguttaranikaya 2.32, Samyutta-nikaya 1.16, 63 (catucakka). 
The compound cakrabheda 'sowing discord' (Mvy 9114), and the Pali 
cakkabheda, parallel with sanghabheda, occurs in Vinaya 2.198, 
3.171. As a technical term cakra hardly fits our context. Though 
the reading cakra may be explained, yet nakra would be preferable if 
it can be read on the stone inscription. That would counterpoise 
the saiksa against nakra 'alligator and asaiksa contra makara. It 
would be better diction. Casparis reads sunyatani svaro where svaro 
is a dubious reading. Sunyata (Edgerton 1953:532) is often asso- 
ciated with animitta and apranihita in Saddharma-pundarika 101.1, 
136.13, 137.2, Lalitavistara 422.20, sunyatani mitta-prani hitam in

12
Saddharma-pundarika 101.1, 136.13, sikṣamuccaya 6.15 (Edgerton 1953: 
47b). In Pali it is used as an epithet of vi mokkha, nibbana, also 
as a substitute for the latter (Edgerton 1953:47a). In the 
inscription sunyatani svaro (?) is followed by nirmoksai karasah and 
it would be better to read it as sunyatani mitto. In the second 
quarter, subhasi ta-maharatnakaro means that while the ocean is 
replete with riches of the deep, the Buddha is an endless treasure- 
house of noble words. hrihradah is translated Casparis as 'the 
Lake of Modesty': can there be a lake in the ocean? It should have 
a meaning more coherent in this passage. Hradin abounding in 
water (as a river)' MBh., Harivansa, Ramayana (MW.1306-7), hrad 
'to sound, roar...', hradayati 'to cause to sound, to refresh, 
delight'. The original meaning of hrT may be gleamed from the 
Pali phrases hiri-nisedha 'restrained by conscience', hiri-bala 
'the power of conscientiousness', hiri-mana 'conscientious', ahirika 
'shameless, unscrupulous', hiriyati 'to feel conscientious scruple' 
(Davids/Stede 1921). Thus hrada refers to the surging waters 
breaking in the joy (hrad/hlad) of waves, and this oceanic abandon 
of the Buddha is the overflow of Cosmic Consciousness that He is. 
The third quarter sangudartha-vi carana is rendered by Casparis as 
'the discussion on hidden (?) meanings'. It is a reference to the 
constant development of Buddhist thought culminating in the esoteric 
systems of the tantras. This becomes clear when we bear in mind 
that the present inscription pertains to a monastery of the Abhayagiri 
denomination, which was constantly in touch with developments of 
Buddhist thought in the mainland of India, in contradistinction to 
their opponents the adherents of Mahavihara. The static orthodoxy 
of the Theravadins of Mahavihara was in sharp contrast to the ever- 
new philosophic dynamism of the Abhayagiri-vāsins. This was pre- 
dominantly in the context of the development of the esoteric 
(sangudha) doctrine of Tantras, which samapyayi ta 'nourished, invi- 
gorated and refreshed' (MW) the new order. The torrenti al flow 
(vega) of mighty (vara) rivers emptying into the ocean is put into 
bounds (vaddha) by undefiled (amala) beaches (vela). This brings us 
to the fourth quarter: siksa-vandana-vaddha-velam amalam which is

13
translated by Casparis as 'whose tides reflect the praising of the 
(Three) Instructions'. shore' Here vela is not tide, but 'coast 
9
(velavam 'on the seashore, coastwise, MBh. (MW.1018). Vela is 
"boundary of sea and land (personified as the daughter of Meru and 
Dharini, and the wife of Samudra)" (MW). Siksa are the Three 
Instructions of the Vinaya in reference to moral conduct (adhiśīlam), 
by the Sutra in reference to thought, intellect (adhicittam), and 
by the Abhidharma in reference to wisdom, insight (adhi prajñam). 
Vandana is the first of the seven acts of worship (saptavidha anuttara- 
pua) which are enumerated in Dharmas angraha 14. Siksa refers to 
the way of sravakas and vandana to that of Mahayana. This twofold 
division is well known in Tibet (Lessing/Wayman 1968:17,21).
11. The first three invocatory stanzas refer to Sumeru, 
fire (vahni) and waters (arnava), corresponding to the mahabhuta or 
elements: earth, water, fire and the fourth element wind may be 
found in the succeeding stanza. The four elements alone are 
recognised by Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakosa (Visser 1931:6). The 
fifth element akasa 'ether' is not included in his system. In the 
Vajradhātu mahamandala too only these four elements guard its corner 
directions (Lokesh Chandra 1972:464-467).
12. In the three stanzas the terms lokadharma, gaiksāśaiksa, 
sunyatani mitta refers to śravakayana (Theravada). subhasita- 
maharatnakara may veil an allusion to the Ratnakuta sūtras. 
Ratnakara is the name of a mountain in the Mahamayuri 253.32 
(Edgerton 1953:452b), and the Ratnakuta sutras of the Andhrakas are 
mentioned in the Mkaya-sangraha as being prevalent in Srilanka 
(Mudiyanse 1967:17). The Abhayagiri-vasins were assailed by 
orthodox Theravada sects but remained unperturbed and unshaken 
(na samkampitaḥ). They went on progressing into the ever-evolving 
world of Buddhism, from the Vedalla/Vetulla/Vepulla sutras into 
Vajrayana. The Nikaya-sangraha explicitly states that their 
Vetulla-piṭaka had texts of all shades of the spectrum of Vetullavada 
from early Mahayana to Ratnakuta and finally to the Tantras. 
Sangūḍartha-vicarana-vara-nadi-vegaiḥ samapyayi tam refers to the

14
spread of esoteric (samgudha) texts of the various tantras in 
Srilanka. This brings us to the consideration of the denominational 
system or systems prevalent among the adherents of Abhayagiri who 
went to Indonesia.
13. In the reign of Voharika Tissa (A.D.209-301) the 
Abhayagiri-vasins who "had earlier received a body of Vajji putta 
monks from Pallarama in India led by their teacher Dhammaruci, are 
reported to have adopted some views belonging to the Vetulya-vada" 
(Zeyst 1961:25). "In the time of Silakala (518-531) a Vai pulya 
Sutta (Mahāyāna text) known as Dhammadhatu was brought from India 
by a merchant of Kasi, named Purna. This text was readily accepted 
by Abhayagiri and was honoured in the palace". In the ninth century 
a follower, of the "Vajraparvata sect in India came to reside in 
Abhayagiri from where he spread his secret teachings" (ibid:26) 
"The Abhayagiri monks seem to have kept up constant contact with 
various Buddhist sects and new movements in India, from which they 
derived inspiration and strength The Dhammarucikas of Abhayagiri 
are supposed to have accepted the Vetulya-pitaka. The Vetulyas or 
adherents of Vetulla-vada are well known by name both in the 
Sinhalese chronicles and in the commentary to the Kathavatthu" 
(ibid.27). In Pali Vetulla, Vetulya occurs as a dissenting sect in 
vada (Mahavamsa 36,41, DIpavansa 22,45) and in vadin. Davids/Stede 
say that the "Pali form is not clear; it probably rests on dialectical 
translation of a later term" Vai tulya is a derivative of vitula 
'incomparable', vi 'not' tula 'comparable', like atula. In Pali, 
which preserves an earlier tradition, the form vepulla does not 
occur as a variant for vetulla.
14. The word Vetulla is Vaitulya in Sanskrit. In the 
Kashgar manuscript of the Saddharma-pundarika, the title is 
'constantly' sutram mahavai tulyam bodhi sattvotpadam (Kern 1909, 
preface ix, 65 n.1) instead of the Nepalese sutrantam mahavai pulyam 
bodhisattvavavādam. In the Central Asian manuscript of the 
Mahāparinirvana-sutra written in Upright Gupta script we get sarva- 
mahayana-sutra vai tulya-param-amrta-saddharma (Hoernle 1916:95.8)

15
sikṣāsamuccaya (ed. Bendall 354.6, 415) cites from the Candra- 
pradi pa-sūtra (=Samadhiraja) : vai tulya-siksi täh, where Tibetan 
has rab-rgyas-dag-gis bslabs which is a translation of vaipulya 
and dag-gis is instrumental plural. The Samadhi raja-sutra is also 
a vai pulya-sutra (Mudiyanse 1967:18). In later manuscripts vai tulya 
has been replaced by vai pulya. Saddharma-pundarika calls itself a 
vai pulya-sūtra-raja (1.3), and speaks of the plurality of vai pulya- 
sūtrani (46.4), vai pulya-sutrana (98.3). This sutra also terms it- 
self as dharma-paryayam sūtrantam mahavai pulyam bodhisattvavavādam 
(19.12), saddharma-pundarikam (followed by the same four words as 
in 19.12) in 21.6, 22.15, 65.1, saddharma-pundarikan nama dharma- 
paryayam sutrantam mahavai pulyam. Vai pulya and mahavai pulya are 
used as synonymous terms. Lalitvistara speaks of itself as a maha- 
vai pulya sūtra : Lalitavistaro nama dharmaparyayaḥ sūtranto mahā- 
Vai pulya-ni cayo bodhisattvakusala-mula-samudbhavanah (4.18), 
Lalitavi staro nama dharma-paryaya-sutranto mahavai pulya-bodhisattva- 
vikriditah (438.20), vai pulya-sutra (7.9).
15. The Saddharma-pundarika, Lalitavistara and Samadhi rāja 
are three of the nine sutras (nava-dharmah) of the Buddhists of 
Nepal, the other six being Lankavatāra, Aṣṭasahasrika, Gandavyuha, 
Dasabhumika, Suvarnaprabhasa and Tathagata-guhyaka (Guhyasamāja). 
These nine texts might have formed a part of the Vaitulya-piṭaka 
of the Vaitulyavadins, referred to in the Nikayasangraha 32, along 
with other texts.
16. The Saddharma-pundarika, Lalitavistara and Samadhirāja 
were (Maha) Vai tulya/Vai pulya texts as is evident from these Sanskrit 
texts themselves. The Tibetan and Chinese titles show that there 
were other texts of the (maha) vai pulya class: The Avatamsaka is a 
mahavai pulya sutra: it is entitled Buddhavatamsaka nama mahavaipulya- 
sutra in the Tibetan Kanjur (Toh.44) and Mahavai pulya Buddhavatansaka- 
sutra in the Chinese translation (Nj.87-T.278, Nj.88=T.279). The 
Mahavai rocanabhi sambodhi-vikurvit-adhisthana-vai pulya-sutrendra- 
raja nama dharma-paryaya (Toh.494, T.848-Nj.530) is the basic text 
(mula-tantra) of the division of carya-tantras.

16
17. The tradition of the Vaitulya/Vai pulya sutras starting 
with the Saddharmapundarika, Lalitavistara and others continued to 
develop, culminating in Vajrayana. This sequence of development is 
preserved and owned in its entirety by the Vajrayana tradition in 
the following classification :
A (1) the biography of Sakyamuni
(2) compilation of the Word by the great śravakas in the
Hinayana tradition
(3) compilation of the Word in the Mahayana tradition.
B Sutras which show principally the Parami ta-yana fall into 
four groups:
(1) Vinaya-vastu arising from the first promulgation (bkah) 
which was the Wheel of the Law concerning the Four Truths 
(Toh.1-7).
(2) The Prajña-pāramita side arising from the intermediate 
(promulgation) which was the Wheel of Law concerning lack 
of characteristics (i.e. sunyata) (Toh. 8-30). 
(3) The Ratnakuta and Avatamsaka arising from the last 
(promulgation) which was the Wheel of Law concerning 
perfect discrimination (1.e. yoga experience) (Toh.44 
Avatamsaka and 45-93 Ratnakuṭa).
(4) The numerous sutras which pertain in some measure to all 
three Wheels of Law, arranged in a single major class 
(Toh.94-359).
C
Tantras which show principally the Vajrayana fall into four groups: 
(1) Anuttara-yoga-tantra (Toh.360-478)
(2) Yoga-tantra (Toh.479-493)
(3) Carya-tantra (Toh.494-501)
(4) Kriya-tantra (Toh.502-827)
18. The Abhayagiri-vasins followed the same tradition of 
accepting the entire evolution of Buddhism over the centuries. 
Hsüan-tsang says that the Abhayagiri-vasins "studied both vehicles, 
and widely diffused the Tripitakas" (Beal 1884:2.247), which shows 
their ecumenical approach. The Nikaya-sangraha (p.20) records that

17
in the reign of Sena I (846-866) vajiri ya-vada was introduced to the 
Virankura monastery by a monk of the Vajraparvata-nikaya of India, 
and the king accepted these doctrines (Mudiyanse 1967:8). In a prior 
context the Nikaya-sangraha (p.9-10, Mudiyanse 1967:17) enumerates 
the titles of 34 works of different divisions of tantras:
(1) Varna-pitaka of the Hemavatas
(2) Angulimala-pitaka of the Rajagirikas
(3) Gudha-Vessantara of the Siddharthakas
(4) Raṣṭrapala-garjjita of the Purvasai līyas 
(5) Alavaka-garjjita of the Aparasailiyas 
Works by Vajrapartavasins(6-31)
(6) Gudha-Vinaya
(7) Mayajala-tantra
(8) Samaja-tantra
(9) Mahasamaya-tattva-tantra
(10) Tattva-sangraha-tantra
(11) Bhutaḍamara-tantra
(12) Vajramṛta-tantra
(13) Cakra-samvara-tantra 
(14) Dvadaśacakra-tantra 
(15) Herukadbhuta-tantra 
(16) Mahamaya-tantra 
(17) Padanikṣepa-tantra 
(18) Catuspiṣṭa-tantra 
(19) Paramardda-tantra 
(20) Mari cyudbhava-tantra 
(21) Sarvabuddha-tantra 
(22) Sarvaguhya-tantra 
(23) Samuccaya-tantra
(24) Raja-kalpa
(25) Herambha-kalpa
(26) Trisamaya-kalpa
(27) Raja-kalpa
(28) Vajra-gandhara-kalpa
(29) Mari ci-guhya-kalpa

18
(30) Suddha-samuccaya-kalpa
(31) Maya-Mari ci -kalpa
(32) Vaitulya-pitaka of the Vai tulyavadins 
(33) Ratnakuța sutras of the Andhrakas
(34) Aksarasäriya-sutra of the Mahasanghikas
19.The aforesaid texts can be arranged into the following 
groups according to the Vajrayana system of classification (Lessing/ 
Wayman 1973:233-239):
Ratnakuta genre of texts (Toh.45-93, Ns.34)
Sutras
Rastrapala-pari precha (Toh.62, Ns.4)
Angulimaliya (Toh.213, Ns 2)
Anuttara-yoga-tantras
Herukabhyudaya (Toh. 374, Ns.15Herukadbhuta-tantra. Tantras
pertaining to the Heruka group are Toh. 368-427).
Cakras amvara-tantra(Toh. 385, Ns.13)
Mahasamaya-tantra-raja (Toh. 390, Ns.9 Mahasamaya-tattva-tantra) 
Mahamaya-tantra-raja (Toh.425, Ns.16 omits Oraja)
Catuspi tha-vikhyāta-tantra-raja (Toh.430, Ns.18 Catuspi tha-tantra) 
Vajramṛta-tantra (Toh.435, Ns.12)
Guhyasamaja-tantra (Toh.449, Ns.8 Samaja-tantra). The Guhyasamāja 
section extends from Toh.442 to Toh.453 (both inclusive, 
Wayman 1973:235).
Mayājāla-mahatantra-raja (Toh.466, Ns. 7 Mayajala-tantra)
Yoga-tantras
Tattva-sangraha (Toh.479, Ns. 10 adds tantra)
Paramadya nama mahāyāna-kalparaja (Toh.487, Ns.19 Paramarda-tantra)
Carya-tantra
Padanikṣepa-tantra (Ns.17). Padanikṣepa is one of the Eight 
Mahavidyaraja in Shingon or Japanese mantrayana (Taisho Zuzo 164

19
no.1, 165 no.1 Hachi-dai-myōō-zuzō 'figures of asta-mahavidyaraja', 
two scrolls kept at the Daigoji monastery).
Kriya-tantras
Maya-Mari ci-jata-tantrad uddhṛtam kalpa-raja (Toh.565, Ns. Maya- 
Marici-kalpa)
Mari cy-udbhava-tantra (Ns.20), Marici-kalpa (Ns.24), Marici-guhya- 
kalpa (Ns.29) can be compared to Toh.566.
Bhutaḍamara-mahatantra-raja (Toh. 747, Ns.11 B.-tantra)
General
Kriya-samuccaya (Toh.3305, Ns.23 Samuccaya-tantra)
Trisamayaraja-sadhana (Toh. 3144,3401), Trisamaya-samaya-sadhana 
(Toh.3147) can be compared to Tri samaya-kalpa (Ns.26) and Raja- 
kalpa (Ns.27)
Vajragandhara-kalpa (Ns.28) can be compared to Vajragandhari-sadhana
(Toh.3260,3385,3594,3595).
20.The Nikaya-sangraha makes it explicit beyond doubt that 
the Ratnakuta and all the four divisions of Tantras were prevalent 
in Srilanka among the Abhyagiri-vasins, who shared this rich pre- 
Tantric and Tantric heritage with the Indonesians. The mention of 
Tattva-sangraha-tantra (Ns.10), the basic text (mula-tantra) of the 
yoga-tantras is of special importance. Quotations from an explanatory 
tantra of yoga-tantras, namely, the śri-paramadya-mantra-kalpa- 
khanda (Toh.488), also known as Adhyardha-satika Prajñāpāramitā in 
its Chinese version, have been traced in the Indonesian text San hyan 
Kamahayanan Mantranaya (Jong 1974:469). The Tattva-sangraha is 
important because it is visualised as the Vajradhātu-mandala. Its 
graphic expression is a painting of this mandala. This mandala can 
also be constructed as a gigantic architectural structure, which in 
terms of Tantric ritual is adharotpatti. In tantric rites meditation 
with japa or muttering is divided into three sections: (1) prelimi- 
nary acts, (ii) main part, and (iii) terminating acts. The main part 
has, inter alia, generation of deity in front in six steps. The

20
first step is adharotpatti or generation of the residence for 
the deities and the second step is invitation to the deities to be 
resident therein (adheya). These details have been cited earlier 
in paragraph 8. It has to be borne in mind that the ocean (arnava) 
and Sumeru were vital to Tantric evocation and elaborate reference 
to them in the invocatory stanzas of the Ratubaka Inscription 
implies a Tantric milieu in which it was written. The Ratubaka 
Inscription attains fundamental relevance to the definition of the 
general framework of Sailendra monuments for it provides us the 
denominational context in which these works of great art arose 
within less than a century.
21. The Ratubaka Inscription provides the following foot-
holds:
(1) The Abhayagiri-vasins were present in Indonesia inA.D.792/
(2)A monastery was constructed for them by a Sailendra king, in 
which Padmapāņi was consecrated and Padmapāņi Avalokitesvara 
stems from the Saddharma-pundarika. The Ratubaka complex 
could well be this monastery.
(3) The Abhayagiri-vasins followed Vaitulyavada which comprised 
Vait (p)ulya sutras like Lalitavistara, Saddharma-pundarika 
and the Tantras as can be ascertained from the list of the 
Nikaya-sangraha.
(4) The invocatory stanzas of the inscription refer to Sumeru and 
the Ocean whose evocation is the first step in Tantric ritual
It implies that they were written in the milieu of Vajrayana. 
The Sailendras were followers of Vajrayana and the presence 
of Abhayagiri-vasins was but natural. The fame of Indonesian 
centres of Vajrayana had reached far and wide, so much so 
that Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra visited Indonesia 
in the eighth century, prior to their journey to China where 
they resided for life, and translated Tantras into Chinese to 
introduce Vajrayana there.
(5) The contacts of Abhayagiri with Indonesia and the multiplidty 
of textual traditions followed at Abhayagiri lends confirma- 
tion to the fact that the Sailendra monuments should also

21
pertain to the immensity (vai pulya) of the sutras and tantras, the 
various stages of whose continuous development were preserved in the 
synthesis of the ecumenical approach of Vajrayana, and that the 
Barabudur was an expression of this broad and universal approach. 
We cannot but agree wth Prof. de Casparis "that there are a number 
of contemporary or near-contemporary inscriptions which may throw 
light on the basic problems of Barabudur", though his presumption 
will have to undergo modifications in details. For instance he says 
that the Javanese text San hyan Kamahāyānikan is based on "still 
unidentified Indian prototype (or on several prototypes)": two of 
the prototypes have been identified by Jong (1974). The Ratubaka 
Inscription does not refer specifically to any monument, certainly 
not to the Barabudur, in the compound Savuddha-Sumeru but only to 
its general context indicated above. It points to the fact that the 
8/9th century was the golden age of Vajrayana in Java, when the 
Barabudur came into existence. As we have already shown in a paper 
to be published in the proceedings of the seminar on "The Symbolism 
of the Stupa" held at the South Asia Institute, Heidelberg in 1978, 
the Barabudur was the Sumeru, the residence for the images of 
deities to be resident. The bipolarity of the adhara (Sumeru) 
and adheya (deities) was also expressed in the Barabudur being in 
stone and the deities in precious metals and hence now lost.

GANESA IN JAPAN

GANESA IN JAPAN
The manifestation of divinity which our senses can perceive can be 
expressed in terms of category. All that can be comprehended is a category, a 
gana (ganyante buddhyante te gaṇaḥ). Category is the fundamental element of 
existence. Lording over these categories is Ganapati, the Cosmic Person. The 
Elephant-headed Man, as Ganapati is, expresses the unity of man the 
microcosm with the Great Being, the Macrocosm, pictured as an elephant. 
Ganapati is obese, because many universes were born from His belly (tasyodarāt 
samutpannam nānāviśvam), yet He Himself transcends all.
As the spirit of Japan chose the transcendental path in the unique perso- 
nality of Kobo daishi, Gaṇeśa became a part of Japanese esoterism, of her 
Mantrayana. In 804 Kobo daishi (774-835) went to China 'to search the 
Dharma', where esoterism was at its apogee, with the Chinese translations of 
basic texts and commentaries already accomplished by the great Acaryas of 
India like Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra.
Amoghavajra or Amoghajñāna (705-774) was a Brahmin who arrived at 
the Chinese capital Lo-yang in 720 and he was ordained at the Kuang-fu temple 
in Lo-yang. The Chinese Emperor lavished favours on him and he was held 
in the highest veneration at the court. Yuan-chao wrote of him as "the one 
who excels all ancients and moderns" in his "Memorials of Amogha, the Tripi- 
taka-bhadanta of Eloquence and Wide Wisdom" (Taisho 2120). He was also 
responsible for collecting all the Sanskrit manuscripts that lay scattered in the 
monasteries of the Empire, for their restoration, translation and propagation. 
Amogha's major subject of study under Vajrabodhi was the kalpa of Vajradhātu. 
This formed the fundament for the development of his thought that "the 
mantric method is a more efficient expedient than the exoteric in practice and 
achievement" (Ency. Buddh. 1:485). The translation of complex Mantrayanic 
texts into Chinese was well-nigh impossible. It was only the genius of Amo-

ghavajra who lived the major part of his life in China and his perfect command 
of Chinese that enabled him to translate abstruse Sanskrit texts into Chinese 
with eloquent fluency. He rendered into Chinese extracts of the kalpa of 
Vajradhātu, which forms a part of the First Assembly in the Vajrasekhara-yoga- 
sūtra, under the title Chin-kang-ting-i-ch'ieh-ju-lai-chen-shih-she-ta-chèng-hsien-chèng- 
ta-chiao-wang-ching, or whose Sanskrit would be: Vajrasekhara-sarvatathāgata-Tattva- 
samgraha-mahayana-pratyutpannābhisambuddha-mahatantrarāja-sūtra (Taisho 865). 
Hence onwards Vajradhātu-kalpa became the foundation of various con- 
templative systems of esoteric yoga, in which Gaṇeśa occupied a place of 
honour.
Amoghavajra had a brilliant Chinese disciple Hui-kuo (746-805), from 
whom Kobo daishi received his abhişeka or initiation into Mantrayana. Kobo 
daishi assimilated the quintessence of the new Way of the Mantra, which had 
been transplanted to China but was to find its efflorescence and fruition in 
Japan. In 806 Kobo daishi returned to Japan with profound Gods born unto 
him, with homa consuming baser passions, his total being illumined by a new
vision.
While Kobo daishi carried the sutras expounding the Vajradhātu, he also 
took along with him its pictorial representation in the form of the Vajradhātu- 
mandala. Hui-kuo had it drawn, for the sake of Kobo daishi in accordance 
with the Tattva-samgraha, by the famous painter Li-chên assisted by more 
than ten other artists. The original mandala was polychrome. In the central 
Vajradhātu-mandala Gaṇeśa or Vinayaka occurs in five manifestations in the 
exterior circle of the central square called the mahābhūta-maṇḍala. So the 
earliest reference to the worship of Gaṇeśa in Japan can be dated to 806 A. D. 
the year of Kobo daishi's return to his country, Japan.
The Japanese names of Gaṇeśa are Binayaka, Shōden and Kangiten. 
Binayaka is the most usual application in the Hizoki. Kangiten denotes the god 
of happiness, prosperity, and well-being. Shōden can be rendered into Sanskrit as 
Aryadeva. Besides, specific manifestations have individual names.
The five manifestations of Gaṇeśa in the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala are:

123
2. Vinayaka is called Binayaka-ten or 
Kangi-ten the 'god of good luck' in Japanese. 
In one hand he holds a radish and in 
the other a ladḍu.
3. According to the Hizoki, 
which is a collection of 
notes on all the divinities 
and doctrines of Mantrayana 
by Kobo daishi¹, one per- 
forms circumambulation 
pradakṣina) from the north- 
east corner. In the east is 
Vajracchinna or Kongō-zai- 
ten in Japanese². The Hizoki 
(12 b 19) terms it a Vināyaka 
with an umbrella or Chattra- 
Vinayaka. He holds a white 
umbrella. He is illustrated 
alongside (Esot. Icon. 446).
1 Some ascribe its authorship to Wen-pi, but the general consensus is that its author was 
Kobo daishi. It is included in his collected works: Kobo Daishi Zenshu, vol. 5. It is also 
reproduced in Taisho Zuzo, vol. 1. All the references are to the Taisho Zuzo edition.

124
4. In the south is Vajrabhakṣaṇa or 
Kongo-jikiten in Japanese. The Hizoki (12 
b 21) calls him Malya-Vinayaka. He is 
adorned with a garland of flowers. His 
depiction is alongside (Esot. Icon. 451).
5. In the West is Vaj- 
ravasin or Kongō-eten 
in Japanese. According 
to the Hizoki (12 b 23) 
he is the Vinayaka car- 
rying a bow and arrow, 
he is the Dhanur-Vina- 
yaka. He is illustrated 
alongside (Esot. Icon. 
456).

3 Taisho no 1796, translated by I-hang or Ichigyo (in Japanese pronunciation), 683-735 
A. D., a disciple of Subhakarasimha and Vajrabodhi (Hōbōgirin, fascicule annexé, 1931, p. 140a 
s. v. Ichigyō).

125
6. In the North is Jaya or Jōbuku- 
ten in Japanese. According to the 
Hizoki (12 b 17) he holds a sword and 
is of a pale flesh colour. He is the 
Khadga-Vinayaka, illustrated along- 
side (Esot. Icon. 461).
It is worth noting that the Hizoki uses Binayaka as the generic appellation 
for all the epiphanies of Gaṇeśa. Kobo daishi must have obtained it as an oral 
tradition from Hui-kuo, going back to Amoghavajra and Vajrabodhi. All the 
five forms of Gaṇeśa are comprised under the Twenty Devas who are guardians 
of Mantrayana. They are also enumerated in the Kongōchōyuga-churyakushutsunen- 
jukyo (Taisho 866) translated by Vajrabodhi in 723 A. D. during the T'ang 
dynasty (Nanjio 534). The names and the placement of the Gaṇeśa-epiphanies 
slightly varies from one text to another, e. g. in the Kiao wang ching (Taisho 882) 
which was done into Chinese by Danapala in 980-1000 A. D. during the later 
Sung dynasty from the Sanskrit Sarvatathāgata-Tattva-samgraha (Nanjio 1017). 
The five Gaṇeśa are also enumerated in the Kengōjūrokuson (Taisho 881, Tajima 
p. 191).
There are other forms of each of the Five Gaṇeśa in other parts of the 
Vajradhātu-maṇḍala which comprises nine divisions:
65
8 14
923
The names of the above nine divisions are: 1. Vajradhātu-mahābhūta- 
maṇḍala, 2. samaya-manḍala, 3. sūkṣma-maṇḍala, 4. pūjā-maṇḍala, 5.

126
caturmudra-maṇḍala, 6. ekamudra-maṇḍala, 7. naya-maṇḍala, 8. Trailokya- 
vijaya-karma-mandala, 9. Trailokyavijaya-samaya-mandala.The forms
described and depicted above are according to the first mahabhūta-maṇḍala. 
Out of the remaining eight sub-maṇḍalas five (nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) depict them in 
various aspects representing ascending planes of realisation.
Now we shall take up the forms of Ganesa as depicted in the second 
samaya-mandala or dharaṇī-maṇḍala which represents the divinities of the 
mahābhūta-maṇḍala in their samaya or esoteric form, which is figured by one 
or more objects or symbols peculiar to each divinity. The samaya is the vow, 
the resolve, the fundamental characteristic of a divinity (Tajima p. 197). The 
five Gaṇeśa in their samaya forms are depicted as follows:
Vinayaka (Esot. Icon. 537)
Vajracchinna or Chattra- 
Vinayaka (Esot. Icon. 523)

127
Vajrabhakṣana or Malya-Vinayaka (Esót. Icon. 528)
Vajravasinor Dhanur-Vinayaka (Esot. Icon. 533)

128
Jaya or Khadga-Vinayaka (Esot. Icon. 538)
The attributes are placed on lotus-leaves with rays of illumination issuing 
out of them. Vinayaka is represented by a modaka or patisserie. The illustra- 
tions are from the author's forthcoming book The Esoteric Iconography of Japanese 
Mandalas (with its serial numbers).
In the third sūkṣma-mandala the divinities are represented in their samaya 
aspect of the subtle and indestructible knowledge of the vajra, the Absolute, 
whence the She pa huei che kuei calls it a sūkṣma-vajra-maṇḍala. Graphically, 
the divinities are represented adossed with a three-pronged vajra. The Twenty 
Devas, which also comprise the Five Gaṇeśa, are not adossed by a vajra, and 
hence their forms are nearly the same as in the first mahābhūta-maṇḍala, with 
minor variations in the position of the hands. Their graphic representations 
can be seen in the author's Esot. Icon. (Vinayaka 610, Chattra-Vinayaka 596, 
Malya-Vinayaka 601, Dhanur-Vinayaka 606 and Jaya or Khadga-Vinayaka
611).
In the fourth pūjā-maṇḍala, the depiction of the Five Gaṇeśa is nearly 
the same as in the first mandala. They can be seen in the author's Esot. Icon. 
In the original xylograph reproduced by the author, Malya-Vinayaka 676, 678) 
and Khadga-Vinayaka (671, 685) have been repeated and Chattra-Vinayaka 
and Dhanur-Vinayaka are lacking. Vinayaka occurs as no. 672.
In the eighth or Trailokyavijaya-karma-mandala the graphic representa- 
tions are again identical with those in the first mahabhūta-mandala.

129
In the ninth Trailokyavijaya-samaya-maṇḍala the depiction of the Five 
Gaṇeśa is almost similar to those of the second samaya-maṇḍala. They are 
represented by their attributes on a lotus-leaf, surrounded by flames. Their 
representations can be seen in the author's Esot. Icon. nos. 844, 849, 854, 859,
860.
The graphic representation of the Five Gaṇeśa can be categorised into: 
(i) anthropotheriomorphic as in India, and (ii) symbolic or samaya form, a 
tradition lost in Indian art though known from the Chinese and Tibetan trans- 
lations of original Sanskrit texts.
Besides the Vajradhātu-mandala, Kobo daishi had also brought the 
Mahākaruṇā-garbha-maṇḍala. In its Quarter of Vajras, Ganapati is depicted 
with an axe and a radish. His name is transcribed into Japanese as Binayaka 
and in the Siddham script it is given as Ganapata, and the bija is GA (Esot. 
Icon. 348).
There is a lovely illustration of this Gaṇeśa with an axe and a radish in a 
9th century scroll, kept in the Daigoji monastery at Kyoto, drawn in the 12th

130
year of Konin (821 A. D.) entitled Shishu-goma-honzon narabini kenzoku zuzō 
'figures of the main divinities and their attendants (parisara) of the four kinds 
of homa' (Taisho Zuzo 1:837 fig. 20).
In Japanese worship, mudras are an integral part to 
evoke the visual presence of divine epiphanies in the mind 
of the initiate to transform his inner being. According to 
the Japanese work Dainichikyō, the mudras or hand gesture; 
endow the thoughts, consecrations, dharani-mantra, all that 
is beyond form with a visible shape, thereby crystallising 
a trans-material state for meditation. Gaṇeśa is represented 
by two mudras in the popular mudra-manual for worship 
entitled Shingon-mikkyō-zu-in-shu 'A Collection of the Drawings 
(zu) of the mudras of Mantrayana'. Vinayaka has the 
mudra:
There are two mudras of Shōden (lit. Arya-deva) or Ganapati:

The Bussetsu-Daibirushana-jobutsu-jimben-kaji-kyō-shu-shingon-gyo-daihi-taizōshō- 
dai-mandara-o-futsu-nenju-giki, a kalpa for the Mahakaruṇodbhava-mahāmaṇḍala, 
gives five separate mudras and mantras for the Five Gaṇeśa:
(i) Vinayaka and his consort (Taisho Zuzo 8:147 fig. 333) with the mantra: om 
vajra-vinayaka hum.
(ii) Vajracchinna and Vajracchinni (ibid. fig. 335).
(iii) Vajrabhakṣaṇa and Vajrabhakṣaṇī (ibid. fig. 336). 
(iv) Vajravasin and Vajravasinī (ibid. fig. 337). 
(v) Vajrajaya and Vajrajayī (ibid. fig. 338).
Gaṇeśa has also been represented in bīja form. A bija or germ-syllable 
is termed shuji in Japanese. The recitation of a bija impregnates the faithful 
with the energies and essences contained in it, establishing a psychic union 
between the adept and the divinity. On p. 59 of the Shuji-shu 'Collection of 
Bijas', published by Bhiksu Chōzen in the Kwambun era (1661-73) the bīja of 
Gaṇeśa is gah or gaḥgah in the splendid calligraphy of the Siddham script. This 
tradition of the bīja has continued to the present day. In a modern 'Collection 
of Siddham Bījas' entitled Bon-shu Shittan shuji ruishu (Koyasan) the bijas a 
calligraphed by Chōzen are reproduced:
同天喜歡 天聖
REIT
The double gaḥ represents the Twin Gaṇeśa with two bodies. In the same

132
text there is another bija of Gaṇeśa: kam, followed by the mantra om gaḥ goh 
hum svāhā.
In later Tencho era, in about 824, the Takao mandala was painted from 
the original polychrome mandala brought back from China by Kobo daishi in 
806 A. D. It was copied in gold and silver lines on purple damasksilk. Now 
it is preserved at the Jingōji monastery. All the Five Gaṇeśa are painted 
in colours in all their manifestations in the six parts of the Vajradhātu- 
mandala.
Another copy of the original polychrome mandala was that kept at the 
Tōji monastery. In the end of the 9th century its first copy was prepared. 
It was discovered in 1934 in a black-lacquer box which has a lacquered inscrip- 
tion at the back of the lid dated 899 A. D. It is kept at the Shingon-in temple. 
Herein are delineated all the manifestations of the Five Gancśa.
During the Kenkyū era (1190-1198) the Vajradhätu-maṇḍala was painted 
on silk from the original Tōji mandala. It has all the manifestations of the Five 
Ganesa in its six sub-mandalas.
Late in the Kamakura period, in the Einin era (1293-1298) the Vajradhātu- 
mandala was once again painted from the original Tōji mandala. Being used 
over a long period, its colours have peeled offIt has all the manifestations of 
the Five Gaṇeśa.
The Five Gaṇeśa are depicted in their exoteric and esoteric manifestations 
in the following scrolls of the Vajradhātu-mandala:
(i) In the Kōzanji scroll. Towards the end of the Kamakura period, 
in the 14th century, a new copy of the Takao mandala was painted which was 
handed down in the Kōzanji monastery, Kyoto.
(ii) In the Keishō-in scroll. In 1693 bhikṣu Shūkaku painted the maṇḍala 
for the donator Keishō-in. This is the copy in use at the Tōji Monastery.
(iii) In 1773 bhikṣu Jōtō of Koyasan got the Tōji maṇḍala copied by 
Shimizu Nobumasa for being printed by wooden blocks. The size was reduced 
to one-fourth of the original. The woodblocks have perished in a fire.
(iv) In the Hasedera scroll. In 1834 bhikṣus Yukō and Kainyo of the 
Buzan school commissioned the painter Tōshuku Hasegawa to copy the Tōji 
mandala, to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the nirvana of Kobo 
daishi.
(v) In the Omuro woodblock edition. In 1869 Sompō of the Shima 
province got the woodblocks of bhikṣu Hōun produced. They are remarkable
for their clarity. They have been reproduced in this paper.

133
The Five Gaṇeśa are illustrated in their various manifestations in texts' on 
the Vajradhätu-maṇḍala:
(i) Kongo-kai-mandara, kept at the Daigoji monastery, Kyoto (Taisho Zuzo 
1:1021, etc.).
(ii) The Kongo-kai-sammaya-mandara-zu kept at the Ishiyamaji monastery 
depicts only the samaya forms of the Five Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 1:1082).
(iii) The Sammaya-gyo-Hōrin-in-bon 'Book of Samaya Symbols' once owned 
by the Hōrin-in monastery, but now preserved at the Daigoji monastery, Kyoto 
depicts the symbolic forms of Five Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 1:1129, etc.).
(iv) TheGohitsu-shishu-goma-dan-sanjushichi-son-kengō-sammaya-gyō'the
samaya symbols of the 37 divinities, 16 Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa for the 
four kinds of homa altars', kept at the Daigoji, Kyoto illustrates the Five Gaṇeśa 
in their samaya form (Taisho Zuzo 1:1157, 1158 fig. 47, 48, 51, 52, 53).
Besides the main form of Vinayaka (with axe and radish) in the Maha- 
karuna-garbha-mandala and the multiple forms of the five manifestations in the 
Vajradhātu-mandala, there are also other representations of Gaṇeśa in Japan. 
While the forms of the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala are two-armed (dvi-bhuja), elsewhere 
the forms of Gaṇeśa are four-armed or six-armed or twin. Besides the Five Gaṇeśa 
in the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala, there is another concatenation of Four Gaṇeśa which 
is first depicted by Shinkaku in the 12th century, then by Shōchō in the 13th 
century, and in the Zuzo-shō. Some of them have been repeated individually
in other series in works to be detailed hereafter.
FOUR GANESA
Shinkaku (?-1180 A. D.) wrote a description of divinities i. e. the Besson- 
zakki which is now preserved in 57 scrolls at the Ninnaji monastery, Kyoto. 
In his magnum opus Shinkaku has described the images of Gaṇeśa, given His 
mantra, and drawn four forms of Shōden or Gaṇeśa, all in a standing posture. 
Fig. 233 is four-armed, fig. 234 and 235 are six-armed though with varying 
attributes, and fig. 236 is Twin, i. e. two forms embracing each other
(Taisho Zuzo 3:532 ff.).
In the 13th century, Shōchō (1205-1282) of the Tendai sect wrote his 
comprehensive work on divinities entitled Asava-shō. Asava is a collocation of 
Sanskrit bija-mantras wherein a represents Tathāgata the Unborn Eternal (aja), 
sa stands for lotus, and va for vajra; the three bijas symbolising the mantras of 
every divinity belonging to the Mahākaruṇodbhava-maṇḍala. The author 
devotes section 149 to Kangiten or Gaṇeśa and His worship (puja, Taisho Zuze 
9:477-487). It begins by giving the Sanskrit name Ganpati in Siddham letters, 
followed by the Japanese names Binayaka and Shōden. Four Gaṇeśa are delinea- 
ted. Figure 84 depicts the arragement of three altars for the pūja of Gaṇeśa:

134
for the morning offering, late night offering and daytime offering. Figure 85 
shows the arrangement of the general pūjā of Vinayaka deva with the placement 
of the offerings of soup, boiled rice, cakes, radish, fire for homa, etc. (see Taisho 
Zuzo 9:482 plate 85).
Section 150 is devoted to the worship of Udaka-Ganapati who is not 
pictured. The arrangement of his altar is drawn on p. 487 of Taisho Zuzo 
volume 9.
The Zuzō-shō 'selection of figures' which is preserved at the Entsuji 
monastery (Koyasan) in ten scrolls, describes and illustrates the Four Gaṇeśa as 
follows (Taisho Zuzo 3:42 figs. 98-101):
7. Sadbhuja (six-armed) Gaṇeśa (fig. 98). His six hands hold the mace, 
tusk, noose/ sword, bowl and cakra.

135
8. Caturbhuja (four-armed) Gaṇeśa (fig. 99).His four hands hold the
and tusk.
laddu, axe/mace 

136
9. Suvarna-Ganapati or the golden-coloured Ganapati: the word Ganapati 
is transliterated in Kanji (fig. 100). His six hands hold the goad, mace, noose/ 
laddu, sword and vajra-sword.
30

137
10. Twin Gaṇeśa (fig. 101)

138
OTHER FORMS
Shinkaku also compiled the Shoson-zuzō 'Figures of Divinities' in two 
fascicules, now kept in the Kanchi-in temple of the Tōji monastery, Kyoto. 
Herein are illustrated six forms of Gaṇeśa, out of which two are new:
11. Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 3:739 fig. 93).
Twin Gaṇeśa (ibid. fig. 94)10.
Gaṇeśa with axe and radish (ibid. fig. 95)=1.

139
Suvarna-Ganapati with six arms (ibid. 3:741 fig. 96)=9. 
12. Another form of Suvarna Ganapati (ibid. fig. 96).
Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa (ibid. fig. 97)=7.
Kakuzen wrote a detailed study of all the divinities and also drew their 
illustrations in about 1183-1213. They are preserved at the Kajuji monastery 
of Kyoto in 136 scrolls, besides copies in monasteries at Koyasan and Tokyo. 
It depicts nine different forms of Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 5:439-444) with detailed 
descriptions:
Twin Gaṇeśa (fig. 335, 336).
-Caturbhuja Gaṇeśa (fig. 337)=8.

140
13. Caturbhuja Gaṇeśa (fig. 338). His four hands hold the noose, -/ 
vajra, and axe:

141
14. Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa (fig. 339). His six hands hold the noose, mace, 
goad/ sword, laddu, and cakra:

142
15. Ṣaḍbhuja Gaṇeśa (5:442 fig. 340). His six hands hold a mace, goad, 
noose/ sword, laddu and cakra:

143
16. Three-headed Four-armed Gaṇeśa (5:443 fig. 341). Two hands are 
folded and the other two hold a radish and laddu each:

17. Three-headed Four-armed Gaṇeśa (5:444 fig. 342). His four hands 
hold a mace, -, sword, and laddu.
18. Twin Gaja-śīrṣa Varaha-sīrṣa Gaṇeśa (fig. 347). He is the elephant 
headed and boar-headed twin Gaṇeśa.
The epiphanies of Gaṇeśa described above are repeated in other texts, 
some of which are specified below. While the characteristics remain the same, 
their sequence in the hands is slightly altered.
The Tōji monastery has a Shōten-zō or a sheet depicting the figure of 
Twin Gaṇeśa. It was drawn by Chinkai (1091-1152 A. D.). It is reproduced

145
in Taisho Zuzo, vol. 7, sheet 13, no. 223.
In the 14th century Ryōson (1279-1349) compiled the Byaku-hok-ku-shō 
'White Jewel Oral Traditions' in 167 scrolls, kept at the Kongo-sammai-in 
monastery, Koyasan. Its sections 130-134 detail the rites of worshipping Gaṇeśa 
(Taisho Zuzo 7:171-198). There are no illustrations in this text.
In the Shika-shō-zuzo 'figures copied by four masters' Gaṇeśa is represented 
in four forms:
(i) Sadbhuja (six-armed) Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 3:910 fig. 221 = 11.
(ii)Vinayaka with an axe and a radish (ibid. fig. 222) = 1.
(iii, iv) Suvarna-Ganapati with six arms, in two forms (ibid. fig. 223)=9, 12. 
In the Jo-bodai-shu 'collection for the realisation of enlightenment', com- 
piled by Eihan, there is a chapter for the sadhana of Gaṇeśa (Taisho Zuzo 
8:750).
In the Shozon-zuzō-shu 'collection of figures of divinities', three scrolls kept
at Kanazawa-bunko, Kanazawa four forms of Gaṇeśa are delineated:
(i) Sadbhuja (six-armed) Gaṇeśa Taisho Zuzo 12:926 fig. 79)=11.
(ii) Twin Gaṇeśa (ibid. fig. 80).
(iii) Vinayaka (ibid. fig. 81)=1.
(iv) Sadbhuja (six-armed) Gaṇeśa (ibid. fig. 82).
Thus we see that the iconography of Gaṇeśa is very rich in Japan. The 
different iconic representations of Gaṇeśa in Japan may be summed up as 
follows:
1. Vinayaka (axe and radish) 
FIVE GANESA (all are two-armed)
2. Vinayaka (laddu and radish)
3. Chattra-Vinayaka or Vajracchinna (umbrella)
4. Malya-Vinayaka or Vajrabhakṣaṇa (garland)
5. Dhanur-Vinayaka or Vajraväsin (bow and arrow)
6. Khadga-Vinayaka or Jaya (sword)
All have esoteric forms, bījas and mudrās.
FOUR GANESA
7. Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa. His six hands hold:mace,tusk, noose/ sword,
bowl, cakra
8. Caturbhuja Gaṇeśa.His four hands hold: laddu, axe/ mace, tusk
9. Suvarna-Ganapati. His six hands hold: goad, mace, noose/ laḍḍu, sword,
vajra-sword
10. Twin Gaṇeśa.

13. Caturbhuja Ganesa. His four hands hold: 
noose, ?/ vajra, axe
14. Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa.His six hands hold:
noose, mace, goad/ sword, laddu,
cakra
15. Sadbhuja Gaṇeśa. His six hands hold: mace, goad, noose/ sword, laddu, 
cakra (a variation of no. 14)
16. Three-headed Four-armed Gaṇeśa. Two hands are folded and the other 
two hold a radish and laddu each.
17. Three-headed Four-armed Ganeśa. His four hands hold: mace, ?/ sword,
laddu
18. Twin Gaja-śīrṣa Varaha-sirṣa Gaṇeśa.
Gaṇeśa is still worshipped in Japan. At the Jingoji monastery of Takao 
a special temple is consecrated to the esoteric Twin Gaṇeśa and every year a 
worship is held in his honour. In some other Mantrayanic monasteries too 
special shrines are dedicated to Gaṇeśa. Homes in Koyasan are hallowed by 
Gaṇeśa. On the last day of my stay at Koyasan, I sat on a bench for the bus 
to the railway station. Curiosity took me inside the shop and there was a 
graceful image of a standing Gaṇeśa in white wood. My repeated entreaties to 
the shop-owner to give it to me only evoked smiles and polite bowings. Alas 
for my vain desire! The overflowing bounty of the grace of Gaṇeśa still 
glimmers in the adoring hearts of Japan.

HYMN TO NI LAKANTHA IN VAJRABODHI 'S VERSI ON
Lokesh Chandra
International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi
Vajrabodhi, Chin-kang-chih, in Chinese, was a native of Malaya 
in South India. Malaya is located near the Potalaka mountain where 
Avalokitesvara's palace was situated. His father was the Royal 
Preceptor of the Pallava king of Kanchi. He came to China by sea, 
and reached Canton in A.D. 719. By his untiring exertions, Vajrayana 
or Tantric Buddhism gained popularity in China. He translated a 
number of Tantric texts into Chinese. During the years A.D. 731-736 
he translated the hymn to Nilakantha under the title Ch'ien-shou 
ch'ien-yen kuan-tzu-tsai p'u-sa kuang-ta-yuan-manwu-ai ta-pei-
hsin t'o-lo-ni chou-pen (T 1061, K 1270, not in Nj). The literal 
meaning of the title is: the complete and unabridged dhārant of the 
Thousand-armed Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara bodhisattva the Maha- 
karunika. This title was borrowed (with changes) from the earlier 
translation of Bhagavaddharma done during A.D. 650-661. Nanjio 320 
has translated the title of Bhagavaddharma's version as: Sahasrabahu- 
sahasraksa-avalokitesvara-bodhisattva-mahāpūrṇa-aprati hata-mahā- 
karuni kahrdaya-dharani-sutra. It should be noted that Nilakantha 
does not appear in the Chinese title. Nilakantha was an epiphany 
of Hari-hara who was the Sovereign patron of the State (Lokesh Chandra 
1979:12). The epithets sahasrabhuja and sahasraksa represent his 
invincible and all-pervading power lending credence and authority 
to the State.

The NTlakantha hymn is available in eight Chinese translations
or transliterations:

cent.
All the versions show variations in readings and have conspicuous
additions and omissions. In an earlier paper (1979) I had taken up
the reconstruction of the versions of Amoghavajra and Chih-t'ung. 
The se reconstructions can be considerably and substantially improved 
by the version of Vajrabodhi. This paper presents the reconstituted 
text of the Nilakantha hymn on the basis of the Siddham text given 
by Vajrabodhi. The original readings of the Siddham text are cited
in the notes. The Siddham text is preceded by its Chinese trans- 
literation. T. 1062A is again a Chinese transliteration by Vajrabodhi 
of a shorter version of the hymn.
The Sarva-tathagata-tattva-sangraha (p.324) gives the following 
hrdaya of Avalokitesvara: "Om Padma Nilakantha samkha-cakra-gada-
padma-pāņi vyaghra-carma-nivasana krsna-sarpa-krta-yajñopavita 'jina- 
carma-vama-skandhottari ya Narayana-rupa-dha/ra tri-netra
mumcattahāsam, praveśaya samayan, dehi me siddhim, Avalokitesvara 
hum". It has all the four attributes of Vi snu: sankha, cakra, gadā

3
and padma, while gadā 'mace' is missing in Vajrabodhi's version. 
Its Nārāyaṇa-rupa-dhara helps to restore the corresponding reading 
in our version (note 15a).
The present hymn preserves incontrovertible evidence of the 
origin of Nilakantha Avalokitesvara. He is a metamorphosis of 
Harihara, a syncretic form of Vi snu (Hari) and Siva (Hara). The 
hymn invokes Hari in the vocative form Hare twice. Nārāyaṇa and 
Maha-Padmanabha are also invoked. Padmanabha is an aspect of Visnu. 
Three attributes of Visnu are referred to: padma-hasta, cakrāyudha, 
sankha-sabda-ni bodhana. The fourth attribute gada 'mace' may be
found in another version.
Śiva is invoked as Nilakantha, Mahesvara, Ni scare svara, 
Tripuradahane svara, and as the great yogin: siddha-yogeśvara (twice), 
mahāsiddha-vidyadhara, mahāsiddha-yogeśvara, mahāsiddha, siddha-
vidyadhara, sarva-siddhesvara.
His aspect as the supreme siddha can
be seen in Central Asian murals (Lokesh Chandra 1982:1-3). He is 
prayed to as Mahakala, and spoken of as of black colour (kṛṣṇa-varna), 
of the colour of long darkness (dirgha-tama), of the long dark
fortnight (dirgha-kṛṣṇa-pakṣa).The following four attributes also
derive from those of siva:
(i)His hairstyle is a crown of black matted locks (krsna-jata- 
makuṭa-dhara).
(ii) A black serpent or cobra forms his sacred thread: krsna-sarpa- 
krta-yajйopavīta (twice).
(iii) He has subdued the deadly poison: halahala-vi sa-nirjita.

4
(iv)Ile roars with laughter (mahāṭṭahāsa). Aṭṭahasa is specific 
of Siva.
laughter 
to the 
Like siva, the deer-skin covers his left shoulder (vama-
(v) 
vesa-
skandha- sthita-kṛṣṇājina) and a tiger-skin is his apparel (vyaghra-
carma-ni vasana).
"The triple god Hari-Hara-Pi tamaha, who is the same as
Dattatreya, Narasimha, Vamana and Varaha may well be worshipped by 
all, and they bestow their blessings on all alike" (Rao 1914:1.238). 
In the present dharani we find that Nilakantha has the faces of a 
varaha and of a simha: varaha-mukha or mahavaraha-mukha and
simha-mukha or mahasimha-mukha.
The end. fragment of the Nilakantha-dharani in Brahmi and 
Sogdian from Tun-huang (1912) is a valuable help to correct a number 
of readings.Its important variants are cited in the critical
apparatus.
The vocative final e in padma-hasta e, vegadhara e, and rūpa- 
dhara e isa fascinating stylistic element. It foreshadows its use
in Jayadeva's Gitagovinda 2.1. dhṛta-kundala e, 2.2 bhava-khandana e, 
2.3 jana-rañjana e, et passim.

HYMN TO TWENTY-ONE TĀRĀS
Herewith are reproduced two bilingual xylographs of the famous 'Hymn to 
Twentyone Taras.' The first is an illustrated xylograph in Tibetan with an 
interlinear Chinese translation. It was obtained by my father, Prof. 
Raghu Vira, from Peking in 1955. The other xylograph contains the Sanskrit
text followed by its Tibetan version.The Sanskrit is astonishingly correct. This
xylograph was given by Academician Rinchen to my father during his visit to
Ulanbator in the winter of 1955.

THE 19TH CENTURY FRAMEWORK OF BUDDHIST ART AND THOUGHT
Brian Houghton Hodgson, in his epoch-making paper'Sketch of 
Buddhism, derived from the Buddha Scriptures of Nepal (1828) laid 
down the foundations for a study of Buddhist art and thought. At 
that stage of knowledge or rather unknowing, how could he recognise 
that the system of Five Buddhas he was enunciating pertained to the 
Yoga-Tantras. Misnomers like Dhyani-Buddhas and Dhyani-Bodhisattvas 
crept in due to misunderstanding the replies of Pt. Amritananda in 
Sanskrit. Moreover, the posed questions to Amritananda in a theistic 
conceptual framework, because of his Christian background of God. 
It was but natural in the age he lived. These and other acts of 
omissions and commissions, have compounded misinterpretations, and 
played havoc in studies on the origin and development of Buddhist 
Tantras and their visualisation in art. Sculptures and paintings of 
the Five Buddhas over the centuries and in varied climes are signifi- 
cant in supplying chronological milestones for evaluating the evolu- 
tion of Tantras. Besides the yab-yam Heruka, Amitabha and Vairocana 
are kules as of their respective Tantras, and share the common chara 
cteristics of Tantric thought in spite of glaring morphological and 
other differences.
The basis of the present study is the fourfold categorisation 
of the Tantras in the Indo-Tibetan tradition, and their iconographic 
representation from Amitabha downwards. The visual representation 
of the four divisions of the Tantras provides a focal point in high- 
lighting the distinctive features of each division. The specific 
characteristics of each division are detailed in Tibetan by great 
masters. This division was known in Nepal, as evidenced by the 12th 
century manuscript of the Vajravali whose first leaf has the follow- 
ing (Shastri 1917:160, ms. 3855):
Kriya Trisanaya-raja Bhūta-damara-tantra// 
Caryya Vairocan-abhi sambodhi-tantr-adi //
Yoga Tattva-sangrah-adi-tantra //
Yogottara Samaja-tantradi //
Yoga-ni ruttara Sambarodaya Dakini-vajra-pañjara Pākārnava 
Abhi dhanottaradayah iti yogini-tantra //
But this classification seems to have been more or less bypassed in 
India and Nepal since early times. This is evident in the Nispanna- 
yogavall, which is a supplement to the Vajravall, where the mandal as 
are not arranged according to the four divisions. This lack of 
classification in Abhayakaragupta's enunciation of the mandalas of 
Vajravall has been discussed by Tibetan authorities. It is not 
suprising then that Amritananda, the informant of Hodgson, himself 
overlooked it and the system of Five Buddhas of the Yoga-Tantras 
cited by him was taken by Hodgson in a generalised manner. The 
confusion it created has persisted to our day, inspite of spectacular 
advances in the study of the history of Tantras. The concept of a 
generalised system of Five Dhyani Buddhas continues to falsify the 
philosophical contexts and their visual expression. In Hodgson the 
five seem to have the same status, but it is not so. Among them,

4
Vairocana occupies the centre, while the other four flank him on the 
right and left, front and behind. Herein Amitabha is subordinate to 
Vairocana, while in the Kriya-Tantras (that is, in the Sukhavati- 
vyuha system) he is in the centre as the kulesa with Avalokitesvara 
and Mahasthamaprapta to his right and left. The changing status of 
the same divinity was due to the incorporation of earlier traditions 
into the newly developed Tantras. Thus from his original core role 
in the Kriya-Tantras, Amitabha became subsidiary in the Carya-Tantras 
(Garbhadhatu mandala) and Yoga-Tantras (Vajradhatu mandala). The 
same divinity in various contexts represents the evolving stages of 
Tantras: thus it is esential that over-generalisations be abandoned 
so that the origination, characterisation, and evolution of the 
Tantras can be comprehended in right perpectives. Let us first 
understand the error (from Latin errare to wander) and then wander 
away from it.
THE FALLACY OF THE FIVE DHYANI-BUDDHAS.
Hodgson (1828: 28) propounded that "The Dhyana of creation is 
called by one generic name Loke-Sans arjana; and by Five repetitions 
of this, the five Buddhas were created...Each of them receives, 
together with his existence, the virtues of that Jnána and Dhyana, 
to the exertion of which, by Adi Buddha, he owed his existence; and 
by a similar exertion of both, he again produces a Dhyani Bodhi satwa. 
...The names and lineage of these Dhyani Bodhisatwas are as follows:- 
1. Vairochana1.Samantabhadra
2. Akshobhya2.Vajra Páni
3.Ratnasambhava3.Ratna Páni
4.Ami tábha4.Padma Pani
5.Amoghasiddha5.Viswa Páni
"The Dhyani Buddhas and Bodhisatwas are considered to stand in 
the relation of fathers and sons to each other; and as there are 
Dhyani Bodhisatwas, so are there Manushi Bodhisatwas, who again 
bear to their respective Manushi Buddhas the connexion of pupil to 
19
teacher,
Further on p.42 he said: "In the Guna Karanda Vyáha it is 
written, when nothing else was, Sambhu was that is the self-existent 
(Swayambhu): and as he was before all, he is also called ADI-BUDDHA. 
He wished from one to become many, which desire is denominated Prajna. 
Buddha and Prajna united became Prajna Upaya, as Siva Sakti, or 
Brahma Maya. ...In the instant of conceiving this desire, five forms 
or beings were produced, called the five Buddhas..., whose names are 
as follows: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratna-Sambhava, Amitabha, Amogha- 
Siddha,, Each of these Buddhas, again produced from himself, by means 
of Dhyana, another being called his Bodhi-Satwa, or son. Vairochana 
produced Samanta-Bhadra; Akshobhya, Vajra-Pani; Ratna-Sambhava, 
Ratna-Pani; Amitabha, Padma-Pani; and Amogha-Siddha, Viswa-Pani."
The whole thought system of Dhyani-Buddhas and Dhyani-Bodhi-

5
sattvas, and the I collateral Manusi-Buddhas and Manusi-Bodhisattvas 
was neat, clearcut and logical: logic needed no historic authority. 
And, no authority was cited for the nomenclature.
The confusion of Hindu and Buddhist ideas brought into being an 
improper superimposition of theistic constructs like ai varika: 
"The deduction of the five Dhyani Buddhas, and the five Dhyani 
Bodhisattvas, from Adi-Buddha, according to the Aiswarika Bauddhas." 
(p. 54).
The authority of the Karanda-vyuha cited by Hodgson (1828:42) 
spoke of the "five Buddhas" without the epithet dhyani. The notes 
supplied by Amritananda (1826: 16) to Hodgson do not speak of dhyana. 
Hodgson (1828: 27) has interpolated dhyant out of his preconceived 
notion that it is derived from the Sanskrit name for that abstracted 
musing which has found more or less favour with almost all the 
Asiatic religionists, but which is peculiarly and pre-eminently 
characteristic of Buddhism."
Hodgson: (p.42)
"Each of these Buddhas again, produced from himself, by means 
of Dhyana. another being called his Bodhi-Satwa, or son. Vairochana 
produced Samanta-bhadra. 
Amritananda: Vairocano mahabuddhaḥ suvi suddha-dharmadhatutah sasarja 
sarva-bhadrartim Samantabhadram atmajam; Vairocana the great 
Buddha emanated from Suvi suddha-dharmadhatu his son (= acolyte) 
Samantabhadra for the well-being (bhadra) of all."
His 'bodhisattva' 
Hodgson's 'by means of dhyana' is not in Amritananda. 
is an insertion which gave rise to the fake term Dhyani-bodhisattva. 
Son (atmaja) means an acolyte, a spiritual son, and not a physical
son.
Terminological confusion became worse confounded when Amritananda 
tried to explain Buddhist systems in Hindu terms: "we have nine 
Puranas, called the 'Nine Dharmas' " (Hodgson 1828: 49). The Nava 
Dharma are the nine fundamental texts of the Nepalese Buddhists, 
They have nothing in common with the Hindu Puranas, nor with Buddhist 
sthala-puranas like the Svayambhu-purana.
The citations of Hodgson (p. 93) are not precise. He quotes from 
the Dharma-Sangraha:
Pancha-Buddhámnáya.
4 Amitabha 2 Akshobhya 1 Vairochana 3 Ratnasambhava 5 Amoghasiddha 
Pancha-Prajnamnáyí
4 Pandura 2 Lochana 1 Vajradhati svari 3 Mamaki 5 Tara
The original Dharma-sangraha (Max Müller 1885:1) has :
Panca Buddhah / tadyatha //
Valrocano 'ksobhyo Ratnasambhavo mitabho 'moghasiddhis ceti//
Catasro devyah / tadyatha //
Rocani Mamaki Pandura Tara ceti //
It will be seen that Hodgson disregarded the original terms 
Panca-Buddha, and commented instead "These five are the famous Dhyani 
Buddhas." Max Müller (1885: 36) repeated the addition: 'The five
(Dhyani Buddhas. To the four goddesses Hodgson added Vajradhatvis- 
var to rationalise the system of five.

What was the source of the interjection of the word dhyant? It 
stems from t he collocation and then substitution of jñana by dhyana 
(Hodgson p.27):
"The names and graduation of these Jnanas, Dhyanas, and Buddhas 
are thus :-
Jnanas.Buddhas.
1. Suvi suddha Dharma Dhatu.1. Vairochana.
2. Adarsana,2. Akshobhya,
3. Prative kshana,3. Ratnasambhava. 
4. Santa.4. Amitabha. 
5. Krityanushthana.5. Amoghasiddha, "
In Amritananda (1826 15), the Five Tathagatas are emanations of 
the five Jñanas: for example, Amitabha emanates from_samata-jñāna 
(not santa, as in Hodgson), and he is in dhyana mudra.
Kern (1898: 64, 96) speaks of "the five Dhyani-Buddhas of the 
Mahayanists." It was never clarified that the Five Buddhas pertain 
not to Mahayana but to the Yoga-Tantras. The term and ideas associat- 
ed with them continue to persist in Buddhist studies (E.B. Havell 
1908:12).
Alice Getty (1928: 28) perpetuates the fallacious term Dhyani- 
Buddhas, confounds it with Dharma-kaya, and inadvertently correlates 
it to Yogacāras
"According to the Yoga doctrine, the law preached by the Nirmana- 
kaya Manushi-Buddha) is exoteric. When he preaches the 
esoteric doctrine he is inspired by the Dharma-kaya--his Dhyani- 
Buddha.
"The Tibetan Mahayanists do not associate Vairocana with the 
founding of the Yoga system, but the Chinese and Japanese 
Buddhists of the Yogacarya school claim that he transmitted the 
doctrine directly to the Hindu sage Vajrasattva, " (p. 31).
"In India the Yogacarya school was grafted on to the Mahayana in 
the middle of the fourth century by Asanga, ..." (p. 31). 
Getty has rightly correlated the Five Buddhas to Sino-Japanese 
Esoteric Buddhism and pointed out that in Japanese Buddhism there is 
no term like 'dhyani-':
"The group of five Dhyani-Buddhas was introduced into China by 
Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra in the eighth century". (p. 28 n.1)
"Toward the end of eighth century, the Japanese sage Kukai (Kobo 
Daishi) went to China to study the doctrine of the Yogacarya 
school with Hui-kuo (Jap. Kei-kwa), and after being initiated 
into the most secret mysteries of the system, carried it into 
Japan and founded the Shingon sect." (p. 31)
"In Japan the Dhyani-Buddhas are also represented in monastic 
garments....In Japanese Buddhism there is no such term as 'dhyani' 
Buddha." (p.29)
The terms Yoga Doctrine', 'Yoga System' and 'Yogacarya School'

mean the Yoga-Tantras, In Sino-Japanese the word tantra is translated
as教 
chi ao teaching' (maha-tantra-raja isin Nj.1020 
in the title of Tattva-sangraha, translated by Amoghavajra). Hence
the general translation of chiao by 'doctrine, system' instead of the 
appropriate word tantra'. The transition from Yoga Doctrine to Yoga- 
carya (in the sense of Yogacara) was a corollary of inadvertence. 
Her assertion "In India the Yogacarya school was grafted on to the 
Mahayana in the middle of the fourth century by Asanga" in the context 
of Vairocana, means that she implies the identity of Yoga doctrine 
(Yoga-Tantras) and Yogacara of Asangas it is misleading. From Getty's 
statements that the Five Buddhas were carried to China by Vajrabodhi 
and Amoghavajra, and that Kobo Daishi transmitted the doctrine to 
Japan, it is clear that she is aware that they pertain to Esoteric 
Buddhism. She is wrong in saying that the Tibetans do not associate 
Vairocana with the Yoga system. All these errors stem from the 
ignorance that the Yoga-tantras in the entire Buddhist world of Nepal, 
China, Japan, Tibet, and elsewhere are based on the single tradition 
of the mula-tantra Tattva-sangraha. Getty's statement that Japanese 
Buddhism has "no such term as dhyani' Buddha" is significant.
Glasenapp (1940: 82) says that the term Dhyanibuddha has not been 
found in Indian texts so far and is also incorrect. It signifies a 
"meditating" Buddha and not a Buddha "originating through meditation". 
Probably the term is an invention of Hodgson's pandit. Though used 
for a century the term should be replaced by 'Tathāgata'. Glasenapp 
The term arose not with the Pandit, but 
is right in his assertion. 
with Hodgson who misunderstood the essential ideas that underlie the 
Yoga-tantra system of the correspondence of the Five Buddhas to 
differant jñana (Lokesh Chandra 1972: introd. 40).
Edgerton says in his Dictionary (1953: 287b, 400b): "I have 
failed to note any actual occurrence of dhyani-(buddha,-bodhisattval 
in my texts. P. Mus calls them 'transcendent' Buddhas in his seaching 
study, Barabudur, p. 577 ff. (L'origine des Cina Jinas a full discuss- 
ion here).
Kirfel (1959: 45) uses Dhyani-Buddhas as a firmly entrenched term. 
As late as 1976, Liebert (p.79) has entered the term dhyani- 
bodhisattva with Hodgson's explanation without any disapproval. 
Likewise, his treatment of dhyantbuddha is misleading. "According to 
GEM dhyani buddha is an incorrect name, which is not met with in the 
original Buddhist literature, the correct term being tathāgata; how- 
ever, the name dhyanibuddha has won a place in scientific literature 
and is much more commonly used than tathāgata". Promoted by Burnouf 
and used in academic publications for over a century this wrong vogue 
should be discarded. The Tantras have been studied in-depth only in 
recent decades and their findings: alone. have a right to 'win' a place 
in scientific literature. Liebert even innovates (3) the term dhyani- 
buddha-bimba for the image of a Buddha on the head or crown of his 
corresponding bodhisattva.
The wrong terminology of Dhyani-buddha and Dhyani-Bodhisattva, 
started by Hodgson in his brilliant misunderstanding of the complex 
ideas of his Pandit Amritananda was fostered by Burnour through hie

foundational magnum opus Introduction à l'Histoire du Buddhisme 
Indien. The original sin was committed when the Five Buddhas were 
taken as a core element of Buddhism in general and weaned away from 
the Yoga-Tantras to which they belonged. The basic text (mula-tantra) 
of the Yoga-Tantras is the Tattva-sangraha, represented graphically 
by the Japanese Vajradhātu mandala, This long-continuing over-gener
alisation muddled the evaluation of the development and chronology 
of Buddhist Tantras. Resultant misconceptions fogged the distinctions 
of the Five Buddhas in different schools with their own contradistin- 
ctive theogonies. Variations in the names, distinguishing features 
and placement of the Five Tathagatas in the Suvarnaprabhasa-sutra, 
*Buddha-dhyana-samadhi-sagara-sutra, two different series in the 9th 
and 22nd chapters of the Amoghapasa-sutra, Ekaksara-buddhosisa- 
cakravarti-sutrs, Garbhadhātu mandala of the Carya-Tantras and Vajra- 
dhatu mandala of the Yoga-Tantras, have been detailed by the author 
elsewhere (Lokesh Chandra 1980: 26-29). 
mistaken philosophic system around them, has been the bane of Buddhist 
The wrong nomenclature and the 
Tantras, delimiting their scope and confusing their evolution. It is 
time that we abandon the term and conceptualisation of the Dhyani- 
buddhes and -bodhisattvas and take a historically correct view of the 
four divisions of Tantras,
Some ather factors that have marred our understanding of the 
development of Buddhist Tantras may also be indicated.
There is no clear definition of the Tantras.
The Tentras were associated with later periods and with the dec- 
Line of Buddhism: "The decline of Buddhism in India from the eighth 
century downwards nearly coincides with the growing influence of 
Tantrism and sorcery, which stand to each other in the relation of 
theory to practice". (Kern 1898: 133). This was inspite of: "Taranatha 
201 informs us that Tantrism existed and was transmitted in an occult 
manner in the period between Asanga and Dharmakirti, but that after 
Dharmakirti's times the Anuttara-Yoga became more and more general 
and influential. Substantially his statement is certainly right". 
(ibid.)
The separation of Mahayana and Buddhist Tantras led to chrono- 
logical questions: "The chronological questions connected with the 
rise of Mahayanism are too vast to admit of an incidental treatment. 
Here it will suffice to note that the Mahayana Sutra Sukhavati-Vyüha 
or Amitayus-Sutra is stated to have been translated into Chinese for 
the first time A. D. 148-170". (Kern 1898: 6)
The denomination of vai pulya texts has been an enigmas "All 
Val pulya texts we know of are qualified as Mahayana Sutras and consti- 
tute the new or Mahayanist canon. Since we learn from Chinese author- 
ities that the Lalita-Vistara, a decided Mahayana Sutra, properly 
belongs to the Sarvasti vadins, we must infer that the Mahayanists did 
not scruple to adopt such works of the Hinayana sects as fitted in 
with their system, though we cannot help believing that the text must 
have undergone modifications". (Kern 1898 5)
The gradual but continuous evolution of the Tantras has not been 
comprehended: "To the Mahayanists is ascribed the introduction of

9
Dharanis into the sacred texts.How to reconcile this with the state- 
ment by Huen Thsang that the Mahasanghi kas possessed a Dharani-Pitaka 
from the very beginning of their sect? Unless we repudiate the 
truthfulness of the report altogether, we are driven to the conclusion 
that the Mahayanists did not invent the Dharanis, but only appropriat- 
ed them as an integral part of their system." There are, indeed, 
several indications of a certain connection between the tendencies of 
the Mahasanghikas and the Mahayanists". (Kern 1898: 6). According 
to Hsuan-tsang "the old canon of the Mahasanghi kas was fivefold, 
divided into Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma-, Samyukta-, and Dharani- 
(or Vidyadhara Pitaka)". (Kern 1898:4)
Wintemnitz also does not define the Tantras, though he speaks of 
their four classes (1927: 389). According to him there is "no rigid 
boundary-line between the Mahayana and the Mantrayana-Vajrayana" 
(1927: 389). The earliest Tantras are difficult to distinguish from 
The Suvarnaprabhas a bears the stamp of a 
Mahayana sutras (1927: 394). 
tantra (1927: 339). Winternitz (1927: 396) says: "A work which descri- 
bes itself as a Maha-Vad pulyaMahayana-Sutra and as belonging to the 
Avatamsaka, is the Mañjusr-MulaKalpa. Nevertheless, as far as its 
contents are concerned, the work is entirely in the spirit of the 
Mantrayana".
"Thus the Vajrayana is a queer mixture of monistic philosophy, 
magic and erotics, with a small admixture of Buddhist ideas". (1927: 
388). "The only thing which distinguishes the Buddhist Tantras from 
the Tantras of the Saktas, in the sparse element of Buddhism which is 
still to be found in them". (1927: 389)
The European concept of the tantras is summed up by Pott without 
mincing words: "In my opinion it is these elements--pervasion by the 
feminine principle, and the demonization of the deities--which define 
the extent to which one can speak of "Tantrism" in the sense in which 
this term is generally taken today. ...If we ask ourselves whether 
there is any question of Tantrik developments in a structure such as 
Barabudur, then we can confidently assert that here there is still 
no sign of it; i.e., that there is no trace of the influence of the 
feminine principle nor of a demonization of particular categories of 
deities". (Pott 1966 115)
THE CORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TANTRAS IS LIGHT
In Sanskrit we do not have the Buddhist Canon. The Tantras have 
not been classed as a separate section in the Chinese Tripitaka, The 
Tibetan Canon, both the Kanjur and Tanjur, has arranged all the Tantras 
and classified them into four divisions. There are extensive studies 
in Tibetan which elaborate the classification of the Tantras. These 
specialised texts by proficient Tibetan masters survey the whole field 
both in bibliography and in basic ideas. Without them all our efforts 
will be misleading and in vain, as heretofore. The fundamentals of 
the Tantras by Mkhas-grub-rje (A. D. 1385-1438), the chief disciple of 
Tsonkhapa, has been translated into English (Lessing/Wayman 1968) which

10
provides new and authentic materials to comprehend the long develop- 
ment of the Tantras in an authoritative way without resorting to 
speculation. Every one of the four divisions of the Tantras is ch ar 
acterised by its central Tathagata. Thus the core characteristic of 
Buddhist Tantras can best be understood by the iconographic represent- 
ation of the central Tathāgata. The central Tathāgatas are:
Amitabha is the central Tathagata of the Kriya Tantras 
Vairocana in the mudra of Amitabha 
Carya Tantras 
Vairocana in the bodhyagri mudra 
Yoga Tantras 
Heruka 
Anuttara-yoga Tantras 
Amitabha is 'Infinite Light' Vairocana is 'Effulgence' (ruc to 
shine), and Heruka is 10h (he) Light (ruka).
(1) Thus the indigenous tradition makes it clear that all the 
four divisions represent the symbolism of Light.
(ii) This is the Light of Bodhi, bodhi becomes Abhi-sam-bodhi, 
just as dharma sublimates into abhi-dharma,
(iii) The origin of the Tantras lies in a region where the 
religion of Light was predominant.
(iv) The cult of the Sun contributed to this transformation. 
(v) The earliest designation of these sutras was vai tulya (Pali 
vetulla), whose meaning was not clear at first sight and hence in 
due course the word changed to vaipulya,
(vi) A multitude of bodhisattvas assembled on the mythic mount 
Vimalasva-bhava to the south of Rajagṛha to compile the mahāyāna sutras. 
The Council was presided over by Samantabhadra, Mañjusi repeated the 
Abhidharma, Maitreya the. Vinaya and Vajrapani the sutras. The apostles 
of the Buddha have been replaced by divine bodhisattvas.
(vii) The difference from the ancient sutras was that the Vaipu- 
Lya generally ended by parindana in which the Buddha dedicated to one 
of the listeners the sutra so that it may not disappear (yathedam 
nantardhiyeta, Lamotte 1954: 383 n.26).
CENTRALITY OF LIGHT IN VAIPULYA TEXTS
The Vai pulya texts can be distinguished from the Theravada 
tradition on many counts, including the doctrine about the nature of 
enlightenment. While the Sarvasti vadins of the Theravada school hold 
that enlightenment is gradual and requires 34 moments of thought, in 
contrast Vaipulya texts like the Mahavas tu-avadana of the Mahasanghi ka 
school maintain the doctrine of Sudden Enlightenment. This is stated 
in four places in the Mahavastu (ed. Senart 1. 229, 2.133, 285, 416), 
where both Sakyamuni and Dipankara are mentioned together in the 
context of enlightenment (Galloway 1981: 205). Dipankara means the 
disseminator of the light of the lamp. It refers to the fact that 
bodhi is a flash of light, an illumination. The co-occurence,of 
Sakyamuni and Dipankara is a precursor of the replacement of Sakyamuni 
by Amitabha in the Kriya-Tantras. The doctine of Sudden Enlightenment 
closely parallels the conceptualisation of enlightenment as a flash of

11
illumination, whose apotheoses are Infinite Light (Amit-abha) of the 
kriya-tantras, the Solar Light (Vairocana) of the carya and yoga 
tantras, Oh Light (Heruka from the root ruc to shine') of the 
anuttara yoga tantras.
The vow of the bodhisattva in the Akşayamati-sutra (as quoted by 
Santideva in his Siksas amuccaya, ed. Bendall 278) is eka-ksana 
The last word 
samayuktaya prajñava anuttara bodhir abhisamboddhavya 
presages the technical term abhisambodhi of the carya-tantras, whose 
fundamental tantra is Mahavai rocan-abhis am bodhi-vikurvit-adhisthana- 
vai pulya-sutra (T 848). The constant evolution of Buddhism was 
reflected in its terminology: bodhi~ sambodhi~ abhisambodhi.
In the very first chapter of the Lankavatara-sutra, Ravana is

scripture of the Ch'an/Zen denomination in East Asia and thus it pro- 
vides a nexus between the Indian origins of the doctrine of Sudden 
Enlightenment and its fruition in China and Japan.
In the Lalitavistara, which is a vai pulya sutra, as the Buddha 
goes into samadhi in the mid-hours of the night, rays emanate from 
his head which illumine all the heavenly worlds and inspire the deni- 
zens of these worlds (p.3). When the night is done, the gods approach 
the Buddha to proclaim the Lalitavistara which had formerly been 
revealed by Tathāgatas of past ages:

accent is reflected in the new terminology of the earliest Vai pulya 
text Sukhavati-vyuha where the Buddha becomes Amitabha:

Amitabha
Vai pulya
Indra
Mahasthamaprapta
The Life of Padmasambhava (Padma bkahi-than 1.7) has an eloquent 
passage in the Revelation of the Western Paradise bearing on Amitabha:

12
He is enveloped in rays that come from all the heavens, and is 
encircled by the iridescent arch.
To the ten points of space he diffuses a reddish mercy radiance. 
Perfect Buddha, he possesses nobility; male, he possesses vigor.
His Accomplishment through body, speech, and mind, one can never 
contemplate sufficiently.
Ocean of Victory, his retinue piles itself aloft like clouds.
Eye unvarying, he is total serenity in the heavens.
To the ten points of space he diffuses rays of compassion and love, 
and at the extremity of each ray he causes a Buddha to appear.
He diffuses ineffable rays without number, inconceivable by thought.
The Karandavyüha speaks of the rays of illumination; for instance, 
in 261.22 luta ime rasmavah samagacchanti sma?, 265.17 vividha-rasmi- 
nihsaranam pancaman prakaranam, et passin. It is essential to study 
at length the role of Light in the Vai pulya sutras.
The Chinese title of the Pañcavinsati-sahasri ka Prajñāpāramita 
is "Pr sutra (with the first chapter on) emitting light. Its transl- 
ation was completed on 23 July A. D. 291 by Moksala (Nj.2, K 2). Like- 
wise the Dasasahasri ka Prajñāpāramita is entitled 'Sutra of unlimited 
great-bright-crossing (or maha-prajna-pāramitā)' wherein bright = 
prajñā. It was translated by Chih Ch'ien between the years A. D. 223- 
253 (Nj.8, K 9).
In the Ratnakuta sūtra Rasmd-samantamukha-nirdeśa, the Chinese 
title literally signifies the sutra spoken at) an assembly on making 
the light manifest" (Nj. 23/11, K 22/11). It was translated by 
Bodhi ruci between the years A.D. 706-713 (K 22/1).
The Anaksara-karandaka-vairocana-garbha-sutra (K 213, Nj. 221) 
was translated by Bodhi ruci during A.D. 508-535, by Divakara in A. D. 
683 (K 214, Nj.222) and again in A.D. 676-688. It is interesting to 
note that Vairocana is translated in two different ways by Divakara: 
p'u-kuang-ming 'samanta-rocana (Nj.222) and pien-chao-kuang-ming 
NJ.223). NJ.221 does not translate the word Vairocana in the title. 
Mañjusri-mula-kalpa is a mahayana vai pulya sutra of the Bodhi- 
sattva-pitaka: bodhisattva-pitak-avatams akan mahayana-vai pulya-sutrad 
arya-Manjusriya mula-kalpac caturtho nimitta- Jnana-mahotpada-patala- 
parivartah (end of patala 20, 1.2417). The colophons of all the 
chapters in correlation to their contexts, are worth a detailed study. 
8akyamuni invites Mañjusri to proclaim the mantra course of the Bodhi- 
sattva-pitaka (mantra-caryartha-viniscaya-samadhi-patala-visaran 
bodhisattva-pitakam, 1.21). Manjusi occupies the centre of the man- 
dala as a child (bala-daraka-rüpi, 1.73) with rays emanating from him 
(samanta-prabha arci so nirgacchamanaḥ, 1.73). The radiance, illumi- 
nation and luminosity of the rays emanating from samadhi recur const- 
antly in the Mañjusri-nila-kalpas sita-rasmi-avabhasa (1.2), rasmi- 
dhatu (1.7), bahubhir Buddhair bhagavadbhis tam suddhavasa-bhavanam 
avabhasya (1.8). The Vad pulya sutras were revelations of Light, and 
as such Light was bound to play an extensive role in the MMK,

The word vidya as the highest form of esoteric learning was 
The 
equivalent to Tantra, for example in vidyarajñl or vidyaraja. 
word vidyaraja is translated into Sino-Japanese by myo-ō which means 
light-king' (myo 'light, vidya' + ō 'king'). Thus Tantra = vidya = 
light. This indicates the prominence of light in the emergence of
Tantras.
Vairocana is the master of the firstseven assemblies in the Ava- 
tamsaka. 
The central personality in these assemblies "unfolds the 
brightness of his wisdom through the power of the Buddha" (Beatrice 
1934: 281). "Interpenetration is the doctrine taught in the Kegon 
(Avatamsaka). When we look at the world in the spiritual light of 
Vairochana Buddha, we see it full of radiance, indeed a world of pure 
light". (ibid: 282). "When we do not see this radiant world of the 
Buddha's enlightenment in which Pure World everything is interpenetra 
ting, the Buddha feels sorrow for beings and puts forth his activity 
to help all these beings to attain enlightenment.
Once Buddha dwelt at
...Now let us consider the Gandavyuha. 
Sravasti in the grove of Jetavana in the garden of Anathapindi ka. In 
that assembly there were five hundred Bodhisattvas headed by Samanta- 
bhadra and Manjusi. All the members of the assembly were waiting for 
the Buddha to preach. Then he entered Samadhi (deep meditation) and 
as soon as he did so the forests of Jetavana suddenly became so wide 
that they became filled with an inexpressible number of worlds and 
many Bodhisattvas from the ten quarters came and worshipped the Buddha, 
composing verses of praise. Buddha issued a ray of light from between 
his eyebrows and illumined the Bodhisattvas and all the ten quarters 
and thereby the Bodhisattvas were filled with compassion to benefit 
all beings. bid: 283-4)
The Vai tulya sutras were new, without (vi) a comparison (tulya) 
incomparable. They were also vipulas immense, immeasuable, their first 
manifestation was infinite Light or Amitabhas "But the sheer volume 
of words is nowhere near as formidable as the content itself; like 
most Mahayana Buddhist works, everything is done on a gargantuan scale. 
(Cook 1977: 23). 
If one sindle is good, ten are always much better". 
The later manifestation of Amitabha, Vairocana shared the same immen- 
sity: "The traveler who has seen many of the impressive sights of Japan 
is nevertheless still very impressed by the overwhelming figure of 
Vadrocana, and rightly so, because the figure was meant to impress. 
Todai-ji is the central temple of the Japanese branch of Hua-yen 
Buddhism, and Vairocana is the cosmic Buddha, whose body is infinitely 
large, and whose life is infinitely long. In fact, the Hua-yen uni- 
verse which has been described in the foregoing pages is said to be
1
In the 12th stanza of the Mara-vijaya-stotra we find atula as 
an epithet of mantra and vi pula as an adjective to virtue:
iti totaka-mantra-varar atulair
Pari ki rtya maya tava yarna-lavan./ 
yad uparjitam adya subham vipuram 
Sivam astu tato bhuvi deva-ninam 7/

14
the very body of this Buddha, and his presence shines sublimely forth 
from every particle in the universe. Hence his name, Vairocana, the 
Buddha of Great Illumination, whose light shines into every corner 
of the universe... Tu-shun, the first patriarch of Chinese Hua-yen
says
The past practices of the Buddha Vairocana 
Cause oceans of Buddha-lands to be purified. 
Immeasurable, incalculable, infinite, 
He freely pervades all places.
The Dharma-body of the Tathāgata is inconceivable;
It is formless, markless, and incomparable." (T 1867.513c)
(Cook 1977: 90-91)
SOME VAIPULYA SUTRAS IN SANSKRIT
Edgerton (1953: 570) says that vai tulya is "doubtless secondarily 
modified by confusion with Sanskrit vaipulya from vipula". He gives 
the meaning: "(work of) great extent, or acc. to Burnouf, Introd. 
62f., development." It is applied by the sutras to their own texts; 
like the Saddharmapundarika-sutra
1.3 vai pulya-sutra-rajan...saddharma-pundari kam
19.12 sūtrantam mahavai pulyam (v.1. maha left out)
21.6, 22.15, 65.1, 181.6 Saddharmapundari kam...sutrantan mahavad pul yam
46.6 vaipulyasutraņi vadāmi
98.11 vai pulyasūtrana, 98.11 vai pulyasutrani ca dharayeta.
In the sundry fragments of manuscripts from Kashgar collected 
by N. F. Petrovsky the title is constantly sutram mahavai tulvam bodhi- 
sattvotpadam in place of sutrantam mahavai pulyan bodhisattvav av adam 
(SP. 65.1 n.1). In the Central Asian ms of the Mahaparinirvana-sutra 
we find sarva-mahayana-sutra-vai tulya-paran-amrta (Thomas ap. Hoernle 
MR. 95.8).
Winternitz (1927: 249): "While he sits absorbed in deep meditation 
in the middle watch of the night, a ray of light bursts forth from 
the parting of his hair, penetrates into the worlds of heaven and 
plunges all the gods into excitement. The gods immediately begin a 
song in praise of the exalted Buddha, and soon Isvara and other gods 
appear before the Lord, throw themselves at his feet and implore him, 
for the salvation and blessing of the world, to reveal the excellent 
Vai pulya-Sutra, called Lalita Vistara.
The Lalitavistara characterises itself as: 4.17 Lalitavistaro 
nama dharma-paryayaḥ sutranto mahavai pulya-nicayo 
7.9 idam...vai pulya-sutram hi maha-ni danam/
438.20 Lalitavistaro nama dharmaparyaya-sūtranto mahavai pulya-
bodhisattva-viki ditah.
The insertion of the Trapusa Bhallika chapter in the Vaipulya sutra 
Lalitavistara is an indication that Vad pulya traditions had their 
origins in the dicya regions, whose epicentre was Balkh.. The Buddhist 
monks of Balkh with the convergence of Iranian, Hellenic and Buddhist

15
traditions in their language, ideas, sense of history and world-view, 
could not but enshrine them in the texts they authored, amplified, 
read or adored. It is but natural that odd metaphors in the texts are 
palimpsets hiding such a Weltanschauung of bhiksus of the Iranian- 
association we can discern the 
speaking world. In their etymological 
origins of the tantras with their emphasis on the Light of the bodhi 
or enlightenment of Lord Buddha, which became abhi-sambodhi or super

and transcended into the abhi-sambodhi in Vai pulya/Vajrayana. In 
certain contexts bodhi-manga is replaced by vajra-manda (NJ. 372,373), 
It shows that the more developed conceptualisation was vajra.
Kern (1898: 5): "The Tripitaka properly so called, has for a large 
part yielded the material for the Vad pulya-Sutras, which if not all 
of them were composed by the Mahayanists have at least been adopted 
by them and incorporated in their new canon. Outwardly the Vaipulya- 
Sutras are distinguished from the older Sutras by a different manner 
of composition and by the change of idiomWe regularly find in them 
sections in a redaction in prose, followed by one in verse, the latter 
being in substance only a repetition of the former or, may be, in some 
cases the source of the narrative in prose. The idiom of the pros alcal 
part is a kind of Sanskrit; that of the verses, Gathas, is a veiled 
Prakrit somewhat clumsily sanskritised as much as the exigencies of 
the metre permitted". The summing up the substance of prose into a 
gatha may reflect the fact that the earliest vai tulya sutras originated 
in the NW. The Gatha represented the most sacred part in the Zoroastrian 
tradition of the Northwest.
The Candrapradipa-sutra is cited in the Siksa-samuccaya (354.6): 
naham vai tulya-3iksitah. This passage is from the Samadhiraja, ch. 24 
(fol. 109b of the Hodgson ms. at the Royal Asiatic Society). 
Lamotte 1976 interprets the word vaipulya as follows:
XXV: "The Vimalakirtini rdeśa Teaching of the bodhisattva 
named Unstained Glory' is ranked as one of the developed Sutras 
(vai pulya-sutra) of the Great Vehicle in Buddhism".
lxii: "The theories expounded in the Vai pulyasutras were system- 
atized, probably in the third century, by Nagarjuna, author of the 
famous Madhyamakakāri kā".
1xxxvii: "the Vkn is closely linked to the earliest known 
recensions of the Prajñaparami tas, the Ratnakuta, the Avatans aka and 
the Mahasamnipata, and belongs to the same philosophi co-mystical 
movement. We know how this developed later and culminated in the vast 
collections known by the generic name of Vai pulyasutras".
lxxxviii: "A few years later, in the course of a second, even 
third turning of the Wheel of the Law, Sakyamuni gathered, in śravasti 
or Vaisall, chosen assemblies of Sravakas and Bodhisattvas, taught 
them the Mahayanaand expounded to them the voluminous Vai pulyasutras. 
In general, the Sravakas, who would have been incapable of understanding 
it, got no wind of this teaching, but it was noted by the gods".
Five hundred years after the Buddha's Nirvana, when the Good Law 
was gradually declining and the Buddha's work threatened, the Mahayana- 
sutras began to spread in the world The Bodhisattva •Nagarjuna

16
discovered, in the Nagas' palace, seven precious coffers filled with 
Mahayanasutras",
Manjus-mula-kalpa describes itself as a mahavai pulya-mahayana- 
sutra and as belonging to the Avatamsaka; but the contents are in the 
spirit of the Mantrayana" (Nakamura 1980 319).
"The Prajñāpāramitā thought came to be combined with Vajrayana 
ideas. This fact is best exemplified in the case of Prajnaparami ta 
naya-satapancasatikā, Rishukyo, the most widely accepted scripture in 
Japanese Vajrayana". (Nakamura 1980 320)
The Buddhist Prajñāpārami ta-naya-sutra has a parallel in the naya- 
sutra which formed one of the four or five sections of the Nihsvasa 
tattva-samhita referred to in the Sdok-kak thom inscription from 
Cambodia. This inscription refers to the introduction of Tantric texts 
and the Devaraja cult into the country during the reign of Jayavarman 
II in the beginning of the ninth century (BEFEO 15:70-71, Bhattacharyya 
1982:54).
"The nine main Buddhist texts in Nepal are known as the basic 
Vai pulya-sutras: "This has been very well manifested in the Vaipulya 
Sutra or Nava Vyakarana or Nine Dharmas which contain nine prominent 
Buddhist.works--(1) Lalitavistara, (2) Asta-sahasrika Prajñāpāramitā, 
(3) Ganda-vyuha, (4) Suvarna-prabhasa, (5) Lankavatara-sutra, 
(6) Dasabhumi ka, (7) Samadhi raja, (8) Saddharma-pundarika, and 
(9) Tathāgata-guhyaka. They are also known as Nava Khanda, These
texts are held in high esteem and though these volumes deal with 
different aspects of Buddhist philosophy the Buddha is elevated to His 
divine posture rather than that of a human being as pictured in the 
Pali canon". (Sakya 1981:46)
The Tantras have been explained tanoti vipulan arthan tattys 
mantra-samanvitan (Woodroffe 1975: 34). The use of the word vi pula can 
be significant: does it point to their earlier appellation vai pul ya.
VAIPULYA SUTRAS IN THE CHINESE TRIPITAKA
The Chinese Tripitaka has preserved the most extensive record of 
the Vaipulya sutras. In 1654 Chi-hst completed his 'Guide for 
the Examination of the Tripitaka in 48 fasciculi (Nj.x, xxvi, xxxi) 
after twenty years of hard toil (T 100.74). He has specified several 
Mahayana sutras of the Vai pulya class". Nanjio has reproduced these 
indications of the Vaipulya sutras in his catalogue.
The Chinese word for mahavaipulya is ta-fang-kuang or tang
* Some sutras of the Mahasannipata class (Nj. aff.) are maha-
vai pulya sutras (Nj. 61, 63, 65, 72, 75). The first sutra of the 
Avatamsaka class bears the title Ta-fang kuang fo-hua-yen ching "Maha
閱藏知津

17
vai pulya-buddhav atams aka-sutra" (Nj.87, K 79). It means that this 
collection of sutras was the efflorescense (avatansaka) of the maha- 
vai pulya sutras. Avatamsaka means 'a garland, ring-shaped ornament, 
ear-ornament, ear-ring, crest' (MW). The Chinese translation of 
avatansaka is hua-yens hua 'flower, blossoms' yen ornament': "Hua-yen 
is regarded as the highest form of Buddhism by most modern Japanese 
and Chinese scholars....Hua-yen, Flower Ornament..." (Cook 1977 blurb). 
The Tibetan translation of avatamsaka is phal-po-che or phal-chen which 
means Mahasanghika (S. C. Das), Phal-chen-sde-pa means Mahasanghi kāḥ 
(Blue Annals 1. 243). Phal-cher is manifold, universally, general 
(Jaschke 342 a). The Tibetan term for mahavai pulya is sin-tu-rgyas- 
pa-chen-po (Toh.44). The Avatamsaka was rendered into Tibetan by 
Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi and Ye-ses-sde and revised by Vairocana in 
the 8th century.
The Chinese vaipulya in Nj 252 corresponds to vai dalya in Tib. 
(Toh. 227), so also in Nj 253 = Toh. 227. Vaidalya is thus equivalent 
to vai pulya.
The fundamental Tantra of the Carya division is a Vai pulya text. 
Its Sanskrit title is given in the Tibetan Kanjur as: Mahavai rocan- 
abhi sambodhi-vi kurvit-adhisthana-vai pulya-sutrendraraja nama dharma- 
paryaya (Toh.494). The Chinese title (N 530, T 848, K 427) is shorter
Mahavai rocan-abhi sambodhi-vi kurvit-adhisthana-sutra.
The fundamental Tantra of the Yoga division, Sarva-tathagata- 
tattva-sangraha (Nj 1355, T 874) is also a Vai pulya sutra according 
to Chi-tsing. Texts with the words vajrasekhara-yoga, vajrasekhara 
or yoga in their titles pertain to the Sarva-Tathāgata-tattva-sangraha, 
which is known as Vajrasekhara-tantra. A number of them are classified 
as Valpulya sutras.
*Buddhavatamsaka occurs in the Divyavadana 162.26 "Bhagavata 
tathadhisthitam yatha sarva-loko 'navṛtam adraksid Buddhavatamsakam 
yavad Akanistha-bhavanam...,. 401.168 Bhagavata Sravastyam tirthyan 
vijayarthan mahaprati haryan kritam Buddhavatans akan yavad Akanishtha- 
bhavanam nirmi tam mahat tatkalam tatrai vaham as an maya tad Buddha 
vikri di tam dristam iti. Avadana-sataka 1.87.9: mahapratihary am 
vidarsi tam Buddhavatamsaka-vikri di tam yad-darśanad raja...suprasannah 
... Edg. translates avatansaka as a large number, collection', which 
does not seem to be correct. Avatamsaka means flower ornament. Buddha- 
vatansaka is literally the flower of the Buddha, the flowering Buddha- 
land, on the analogy of Udyana, the flowering oasis of North-Western 
India and of the modern town Chaman 'garden' with its honeyed grapes.
The Divyavadana speaks of the Buddhavatamsaka and Akaniştha- 
bhavana in an ascending orders from the Bu to the Ak. Akanisha-bhavana 
is the paradise of Sarvavid Vairocana of the YogaTantras (Lessing/ 
Wayman 1968: 215). Likewise Buddhavatans aka should also be a paradise, 
the heaven of the Vairocana of Avatamsaka sutras. For the title 
Buddhav at amsaka-sutra we have the anology of Sukhavati-vyuha, Sukhāvati 
being the Paradise of Amitabha.
** See next page.

The Tantra Mañjus-mula-kalpa (Nj 1056, T 1191, K 1138) is a 
mahavai pulya sutra. The Mañjusri-nama-sangiti (Nj 1370, Toh. 360) is 
a Vai pulya sutra. It begins the Tantras in the Derge Kanjur (Toh, 360, 
Wayman 1973: 234).
A survey of the Chinese Vai pulya sutras leads us to the following 
conclusions:
1. Vai pulya and vaidalya are identical terms.
2. The Tantras are Vai pulya texts. The mula Tantras of two of the 
four divisions, namely the Carya and Yoga Tantras, are Vai pulya sutras. 
In the titles they are not termed Tantras. Vaipuiya is an earlier 
appellation of the traditions that comprised/included the Tantras. 
3. The Vai pulya sutras accepted the variegated continuity of develop- 
ment. All the manifestations of Buddhism were owned and the inter- 
dependence of all these traditions flowed into a main stream. We know 
from the Chinese Tripitaka that Vai pulya sutras comprised of: 
(i) Early Vai pulya sutras
(11) Sutras of the Ratnakuta class, like the Sukhavati-vyuha/Nj 
23(5)7
(iii) Sutras of the Mahas anni pata_class, e.g.
*Mahavai pulyamahas anni patasutra (Nj. 1) 
(iv) Sutras of the Avatansaka,.g.
*Mahavai pulya-Buddhavatamsaka-sutra (Nj. 87)
The central deity of the Avatamsaka-sutras was Vairocana, who 
later on developed into the Vairocana of the Carya and Yoga 
Tantras.
4.The Tantras were not reckoned as a separate class in the Chinese 
Tripitaka, as in the Tibetan Kanjur and Tanjur.
5.The Chinese Tripitaka has preserved in the Chinese titles them- 
selves the categorisation of the (maha)vai pulya texts.
Introducing the phal-chen section (f.119r) of the catalogue of 
the Derge Kanjur, Situ pan-chen writes that Vai pulya contains the 
Avatamsaka (phal-chen) and Ratnakuta (dkon-brtsegs) texts:
gsum pa 'khor lo tha ma'i mdo bzhugs tshogs che ba'i skor la /phal 
then dang akon brtsegs gnyis las/

Nj. translates as: 'Sutra on Mahavai rocana's becoming Buddha and 
the supernatural formula called Yugandhara (? lit. adding-holding)'. 
It has to be corrected. The corrections are: 'becoming Buddha' = 
abhi sambodhi, supernatural formula = vikurvita, yugandhara (? lit. 
adding-holding)= adhisthana.

In the eighth century wonder Borobudur, which is a mandala of 
Vajradhātu Vairocana, the reliefs of Karmaribhanga, Lalitavistara, 
jatakas and avadanas, the Avatansaka text of Gandavyuha culminate in 
the Yoga Tantra (Lokesh Chandra 198031f.).
In his Ten Stages of spiritual development Kōbō Daishi (A. D. 774- 
835) owns Confuci ani sm, Taoism, Brahmanism, the way of the śravakas 
(Theravada) and of the pratye kabuddha, Madhyamika, Yogacara, Avatamsaka, 
with their finality in Vajrayana (Lokesh Chandra 1980 33).
The Tabo Monastery, attributed to Rin-chen-bzan-po, bears the 
murals of the life of Sakyamuni (Lalitavistara), the journey of Sudhana 
(Avatamsaka-sutra Gandavyuha) and the central hall is dedicated to the 
mandala of Vajradhātu Vairocana (Lokesh Chandra 198032): the various 
stages in the development of the Vai pulya sutras are thus harmonised. 
The tradition of the Vai tulya/Vai pulya sutras starting with the 
Saddharmapundarika, Lalitavistara and others continued to develop, 
culminating in Vajrayana. This sequence of development is preserved 
and owned in its entirety by the Vajrayana tradition. The transmission 
of the cycle of Tantras commences with Hinayana sutras in the Tibetan 
exegesis of Mkhas-grub-rje:
A (1) the biography of Sakyamuni
(2) compilation of the Word by the great sravakas in the Hinayana
tradition
(3) compilation of the Word in the Mahayana tradition.
B Sutras which show principally the Paramita-yana fall into four groups: 
(1) Vinaya-vastu arising from the first promulgation (bkah) which 
was the Wheel of the Law concerning the Four Truths (Toh.1-7). 
(2) The Prajña-paramita si de arising from the intermediate (promul-
gation) which was the Wheel of Law concerning lack of characteri- 
stics (i.e. sunyata) (Toh. 8-30).
(3) The Ratnakuta and Avatamsaka arising from the last (promulgation) 
which was the Wheel of Law concerning perfect discrimination 
(1.e. yoga experience) (Toh.44 Avatamsaka and 45-93 Ratnakuta). 
(4) The numerous sutras which pertain in some measure to all three 
Wheels of Law, arranged in a single major class (Toh. 94-359). 
C Tantras which show principally the Vajrayana fall into four groups: 
(1) Anuttara-yoga-tantra (Toh.360-478)
(2) Yoga-tantra (Toh.479-493)
(3) Carya-tantra (Toh.494-50L)
(4) Kriya-tantra (Toh. 502-827)
Now we shall take up Vai pulya sutras in the Chinese Tripitaka. 
Either their Chinese title bears the indication that it is a Vaipulya 
sutra or it is specified in Chi-tsing. The Chinese texts have been 
arranged according to the dates of their translations.

VETULLAVADA IN SRILANKA
The word occurs in four forms in Pali texts: Vetulla/Vetulya, 
Vedalla/Vedalha. The term vetulyavada is found in Mahavansa 36.41 
(Stede cites it from DIpavamsa 22.45), and Vetulvavadino in Mahavamsa 
36.111. Stede says: "The Pali form is not clear; it probably rests on 
dialectical translation of a later term". Vi-tula and vi-tulya mean 
incomparable, excellent', and there from is derived vetulya> vetulla. 
Its meaning was not understood and it changed to vaipulya (Pali vepulla) 
the ever-expanding, developing form of Buddhism in contradistinction 
to the comparatively conservative form of Theravada.
The Kathavatthu Commentary 17.6 (text 167, transl. 318) speaks 
of the Vetulya/ka/s: "This view is now held by those of the Vetulyakas, 
who are known as the Mahasuññatavadins". In the prefatory notes C.A.F. Rhya Davids (xliv) asks: "And who shall reveal which divergent group.

33
or groups were covered by the intrusive name Uttarapathakas: -- 'Northern- 
districters? Equally mysterious are the intrusive Vetulyakas belonging 
to a group called the Great-Voiders--Maha-suññavadins". In 18.1 (text 
171, transl. 323), 23.1 (text 197, transl.365) the commentary cites 
the opinions of the Vetulyakas or Vetulyas. They are referred to with 
disdain as "those who hold the view just discussed" (17.7), "adherents 
as above" (17.8, 9), "from the same sources" (17.10), and foregoing 
heresy" (18.2).
The Kathavatthu 17.10 (transl. 321) controverts the view of the 
Vetulyakas:
"Controverted Point. --That it should not be said that 'Anything 
given to the Buddha brings great reward'."
"From the Commentary.--From the same source comes the theory that 
because the Exalted Buddha did not really enjoy anything, but only 
seemed to be doing so out of conformity to life here below, nothing given 
him was really helpful to him. "
Kathavatthu 18.1 (transl. 323) has the following passage whence we 
can deduce that the Buddha was in essence transcendental (lokottara):
"Controvered Point.--That it is not right to say 'The Exalted Buddha 
lived in the world of mankind'.
"From the Commentary--Some, like the Vetulyakas, carelessly inter- 
preting the Sutta, born in the world, grew up in the world, dwelt, 
having overcome the world, undefiled by the world, hold that the Exalted 
One, when born in the heaven of Delight (Tusita-bhavana), dwelt there 
while visiting this world only in a shape specially created.Their
citation of the Sutta proves nothing, since the Master was undefiled, 
not by being out of the world, but by the corruptions of heart with 
respect to the things in the world".
Kathavatthu 18.2 (transl.324):
"Controverted Point.--That it is not right to say 'The Exalted 
Buddha himself taught the Norm".
"From the Commentary.--This is another point in the foregoing 
heresy. The created shape taught the Norm on earth to the Venerable 
Ananda, while the Exalted One lived in the city of Delight and sent 
forth that shape".
Kathavatthu 23.1 (transl. 365):
"Controverted Point.--That sexual relations may be entered upon 
with a united resolve.
"From the Commentary--Such a vow may be undertaken, some think-- 
for instance, the Andhakas and the Vetulyakas--by a human pair who feel 
mutual sympathy or compassion/not passion merely, and who are worshipping, 
it may be, at some Buddha-shrine, and aspire to be united throughout 
their future lives".
The Vetulla-pitaka is referred to by Buddhaghosa in his commentaries: 
(1) Sarattha-ppakasini commentary on the Sanyuttanikaya 2.202 (with 
the variant Vedalla-pitaka in the printed Sinhalese edition C). 
(ii) Manoratha-purani commentary on the Anguttara-nikāya 3.160: 
Gulhavessantara-gulhaummagga-gulhavinaya-vedallapi takanam (no v.1.). 
(iii) Vedallapitaka in Sumangala-vilasini commentary on the DI gha-ni kaya
566
(iv) Samanta-pasādi kā commentary on the Vinayapitaka 4.742: gulhumàgga 
gulhavessantara gulhavinaya vedalhapiṭakadini pana abuddhavacanani.

34
The term vedalha is Pali ve Skt vai < the prefix vi- + dalha = Skt 
drdha Dalha in Pali means fim, strong, steady, proficient. The 
Vetulyakas must have prided in being firm in spite of opposition from 
all around and also strong in their beliefs arising out of doctrinal 
proficiency. Buddhaghosa says that they do not represent the words of 
the Buddha.
The DIpavansa 22.43, 45 speaks of vitanda-vada. Mahavamsa 36.41 
refers to the suppression of the Vetulya doctrine (vetulyavada), 36.111 
that followers of Vetulya doctrine (vetulyavadino bhikkhu) were like a 
thorn in the doctrine of Buddha. Cul avansa 42.35 refers to the defeat 
of Vetullavadino in a controversy at the hands of Jotipala.
The aforesaid Pali texts refer to the doctrine as Vetulyavada, 
their adherents as Vetulyavadino, Vetulya, Vetulyaka, and their Canon 
as Vetulla pitaka, Vedalla-pitaka, Vedalha-pitaka.
The Nikayas angrahaya or Sasanavatara-caritaya written by Devarakṣita 
alias Dharmakirti of Gadaladeniya around A. D. 1400, gives the following 
account of the heterodox sects. It is first given in romanisation by 
Prof. Heinz Bechert:

Its translation by C.M. Fernando (1908: 9-10) follows:
Then the Trthakas, who had been expelled from the religion 
receiving no help from it, departed, and burning with rage they assembled 
at Nalanda near Rajagaha. There they took counsel together, saying: 
We should make a breach between the doctrine and the discipline of 
Sakya monks, so as to make it difficult for the people to comprehend 
the religion. But without knowing the niceties of the religion it is 
not possible to do so. Therefore by some means we must again become 
monks". They then returned, and not being able to secure admission to 
the Theriya Nikaya, went to the members of the seventeen fraternities, 
the Mahasanghika, &c., which had been rejected by it, and entering the 
priesthood without letting it be discovered that they were Tirthakas, 
and hearing and reading the Three Pitakas, they reversed and subverted 
the same. Afterwards they went to the city of Kosan be, and concerted 
ways and means for keeping doctrine and discipline apart. And after 
two hundred and thirty-five years from the Nirvana of Buddha they separate

35
into six divisions, and residing in six places formed themselves into 
the nine fraternities Hemawata, Rajagiri, Siddhartha, Purwas all, Wajiri, 
Vaitulya, Andhaka, and Anya-mahas anghi ka. Of these fraternities, the 
Hemawata heretics fabricated the "Warna-pitaka," giving it a semblance 
of true doctrine and making it appear as if preached by the Buddha. 
The Rajagiri heretics composed the "Angulimala Pitaka;" the Siddharthaka 
heretics the "Gudha Vessantara; 8 the Purvasaili heretics the "Rattha- 
palagarjita; " the Aparasaili hertics the "Alavakagarjita" and the 
Wajraparvata heretics the "Gudha Vinaya." These last also composed the 
Tantras Mayajalatantra, Samajatantra, MahasamayatattvaTattvas ahgraha, 
Bhutacamara, Vajra-mrita, Cakras amvara, Dvadas acakra, Bherukadbuda, 
Mahamaya, Padanihkshepa, Catushpishta, Paramarda, Mari cudbhava, Sarva- 
buddha, Sarvaguhya, Samuccaya, &c., and the Kalpa-shastras Mayamarici- 
kalpa, Herambakal pa, Trisamayakalpa, Rajakalpa, Wajragandharakalpa, 
Marici guhyakalpa, Suddhas amuccayakalpa, & c.
The Vaitulya heretics composed the "Vaitulya Pitaka" the Andhaka 
heretics the "Ratnakuta" and other scientific works; the Anya-maha- 
sanghi ka heretics the "Aksharasari" and other sutras. The different 
methods adopted in these several works are too many to permit of recital 
here. Although many schisms were caused in this manner yet the religion 
of Buddha existed in purity for two hundred and nineteen years from 
the third convocation.
"Out of the works thus composed at this time by the Tirthakas in 
the guise of monks and made to appear like the true doctrine, the 
"Warnapi taka" and other imitations of the dharma remained in Jambudvipa 
alone; the Vai tulyavada, the Vajiriyavada, and the scientific treatises 
named Ratnakuta, &c., reached also the shores of this beauteous Island 
of Lanka,
The Abhayagiri-vasins followed the tradition of accepting the 
entire evolution of Buddhism over the centuries. Esian-tsang says that 
the Abhayagiri-vasins "studied both vehicles, and widely diffused the 
Tripitakas (Beal 1884: 2.247), which shows their ecumenical approach. 
The Nikaya-sangraha (p. 20) records that in the reign of Sena I (846-866) 
vajiriya-vada was introduced to the Virankura monastery by a monk of 
the Vajraparvata nikaya of India, and the king accepted these doctrines 
Mudiyanse 1967:8). Earlier the Nikaya-sangraha (p.9-10, Mudiyanse 
1967:17) enumerates the titles of 34 works of different divisions of 
tantras:
(1) Varna-pitaka of the Hemavatas
(2) Angulimala-pitaka of the Rajagiri kas 
(3) Gudha-Vessantara of the Siddharthakas

Vajragandhara-kalpa (Ns. 28) can be compared to Vajragandhari-sadhana 
(Toh, 3260, 3385, 3594, 3595).
The Nikaya sangraha makes it explicit beyond doubt that the 
Ratnakuta and all the four divisions of Tantras were prevalent in 
Srilanka among the Abhayagiri-vasins, who shared this rich pre-Tantric 
and Tantric heritage. The mention of Tattva-sangraha-tantra (Ns.10), 
the basic text (mula-tantra) of the Yoga-Tantras is of special importance. 
Conclusions: 
(1) Vetulla/Vetulya mean that the doctrine was unique, without (vi) 
comparison (tulya).
a 
(11) Vehement opposition of the prevailing sects strengthened the
resolve of the Vetulyakas, who became known for being unyielding 
and firm (vi 'specially' dalha 'strong').
(iii) The Vetulyakas propounded mahasunyata, even anything given to the 
sangha, to the Buddha was really of no avail. 
(iv) They had their own Canon or pitaka. 
(v) Their Word did not stem from the Buddha,Their views about the 
Buddha and sangha are controverted by the Kathavatthu. 
The Buddha
(vi) The Buddha is transcendental and lives in Tusita. 
did not come to this world (Kvu 18.1). He did not preach the 
dharma (Kyu.18.2). It is a purely lokottaravadin thesis. From 
his abode in Tusitapura, the Buddha sent his abhinimitta to 
proclaim the dharma. Ananda exposed the dharma after rceiving 
it from the intermediary apparition (Bereau 1955: 254-256). 
(vii) They considered the actions of Buddha transcendental and "he only 
seemed to be enjoying out of confirmity to life here below" 
(lokanuvattana)". It was his 111a or lalita (in Lalita-vistara 
lalita has the same meaning).
(viii) The Vetulyakas think that sexual relations may be undertaken.
The Tantric character had become marked already in the Kathavatthu 
commentary which is dated by Rahul Sankrityayana (1958: 106) to 
the first century A. D.
(ix) Uttarapathaka refers to sects that arose in N.W. India. They
were associated with the Vetulyakas.
(x) Vetulyaka and other allied sects were transmitted to Srilanka 
The centre of Vetulyavada was Dhanyakaṭaka near 
from Andhra. 
Sriparvata in Andhra.
(xi) The Tantras were composed by the Vajraparvata heretics, that is, 
the more developed Tantras were written down in the South. 
(xii) The Ratnakuta was a composition of the Andhakas, Ratnakuta became
a part of Mahayana, when it comprehended in its wide sweep all 
the dissident doctrines and became all-inclusive.

38
(xiii) Texts of Srilanka, like the DIpavamsa and Mahavamsa chronicles 
and the Nikayas angraha with its detailed list of Tantras, are 
valuable sources for the history of Tantras in that they provide 
dates of Vetullavada, which is an earlier designation of the Tant 
tradition.
The main centre of Vetullavada in Srilanka was Abhayagiri. The
history of this monastery is important for chronological landmarks in 
the development of Vetullavāda. Let by their teacher Dhammaruci 
Vajjiputta monks from Pallarama in India arrived in Srilanka during, 
the reign of Voharika Tissa (A. D. 209-301). "The adoption by Abhayagiri 
of Vetulya-vada under the name of Dhammarucika, and the increase of 
their influence were the causes of an order for expulsion of sixty 
monks by king Gothabhaya, also known as Meghavannabhaya (early 4th 
century). The monks were not only expelled from the Sangha, but also 
banished from the country". (Mahavamsa 36.112, EBu.1.25). The expelle 
monks enlisted the support of Sanghamitta who was a master of exorcism, 
Sanghamitta came to Srilanka and became tutor to the younger prince. 
When he became king as Mahasena, Sanghamitta had royal support withdraw 
from Mahavihara, The materials of its 364 colleges and temples were 
removed to enrich Abhayagiri.
In the reign of Silakaha (A. D. 518-531) Abhayagiri accepted a new 
Vaipulya sutra Dhammadhatu which had been brought by merchant Purna 
from Kasi.
A monk of the Vajraparvata sect came from India to reside and prea 
at Abhayagiri in the 9th century. Granite tablets with dhārants have 
been found to the south-east of the north stupa (ASCAR. 1940-45: 41). 
They are written in Nagari of the 9th century. "The Abhayagiri monks 
seem to have kept up constant contact with various Buddhist sects and 
new movements in India, from which they derived inspiration and strengt 
They were liberal in their views, and always welcomed new ideas from 
abroad and tried to be progressive. They studied both Theravada and 
Mahāyāna and widely diffused the Tripitakas. The Dhammaruci kas of 
Abhayagiri are supposed to have accepted the Vetulya-pitaka". (EBu.1.27 
"And hence the Vetulyas (Vetullakas) may not have constituted a 
separate sect or school, especially as they are not named among the 
eighteen schools; and the designation then merely stands as a kind of 
nickname for "those of the developed doctrine", or Mahayana in general 
in a way similar to the sobriquet "Hinayana", the Small Vehicle, 
derisively given to the Theravada". (EBu.1.27)
Other Vaitulya sites also exist in Srilanka. Avakana is a site 
of an ancient Buddhist monastery of about the second century A. D. 
(Senarat Paranavitana, EWA 3.327 s.v. Ceylon). Perera (1980: 179,180) 
says: "When the Mahasaya or the great pyramidal stupa at Anuradhapura 
in ancient SriLanka was completed by the monarch Dutthagamini (circa 
161-137 B. C.) it was recorded in the ancient chronicie Mahavamsa that 
among the many distinguished Buddhist monks who arrived at the final 
crowning ceremony of the stupa, to grace the occasion were the digni- 
taries of the monastic establishment of Gandhara. It was the religio- 
cultural contacts that prevailed between the two regions, namely 
SriLanka and Gandhara which may have led to the borrowing of the ideas 
pertaining to colossal statues of the Buddha".

39
"The first attempt in portraying the Great Sage Sakyamuni Gautama 
in stupendous form in SriLanka was the statue that is known as the 
Avukana Buddha. Recent researches by archaeologists and art-historians 
in SriLanka have enabled them to distinguish a close similarity between 
the very name Avukana and the Bamiyan region which was referred to in 
ancient times variously as Vokkana, Avakana, or Vakana and in early 
Chinese literature as O-po-ki-ni. It has been surmised that the above 
toponyms, which were used in early Buddhist Prakrit and Chinese literature 
with reference to this particular region now known as Afghanistan (wherein 
Bamiyan is situated), bear a close similarity between the word Avukana, 
hence could have been responsible in deriving the name used in reference 
to the particular colossus in SriLanka which very much resembles the 
Bamiyan colossi".
A place named Nalanda "in the Matale District; possesses the only 
example in Ceylon of a stone-built shrine in the Pallava style of 
architecture. Sculptured stones are to be seen in the debris formed by 
the collapse of portions of the shrine, which is of Mahayana type". 
(EWA. 3, 329)
The
Amoghavajra made "a long journey to India and Ceylon, as the late 
Master Vajrabodhi7 ordered him to do". (Chou 1945: 288). In the winter 
of A. D. 741 he left on board a ship to Malay Peninsula (ibid: 290). 
"When he arrived in Ceylon, the king sent a deputy to welcome him. 
guardsmen on foot and on horse were stationed in ranks along the street 
when he entered the city. The king, having made obeisance at his feet, 
invited him to stay in the palace to be entertained for seven days. 
The king himself bathed Amoghavajra daily, using a golden barrel full 
of fragrant waters. The crown prince, the queens, 27126297 and the 
ministers acted similarly.
"When Amoghavajra first met the acarya Samantabhadra, he presented 
gold, jewelry, brocade, and embroideries and requested the Master to 
expound for him the doctrine of Yoga in the Chin-kang-ting ching of 
eighteen chapters and the method of erecting an altar in accordance 
with the Mahakarunagarbhadhatumandala in the Vairocanasutra.
"Amoghavajra, after that, had no regular teacher for his studies. 
He sought everywhere for the scriptures of the Esoteric Sect and 
Lobtained more than five hundred sutras and commentaries". (Chou 1946: 
290-291).
In A. D. 746 he returned to the Chinese capital and presented a 
letter from King Slamegha (reigned A. D. 727-766) of Srilanka to the 
Emperor. The Emperor granted him permission to translate all the 
Sanskrit sutras. Amoghavajra had brought back Tantric texts, studied 
the Tattva-sangraha and Vairocana-sutra the fundamental Tantras of the 
Yoga and Carya divisions in Srilanka. It shows that Srilanka was 
famous as a seat of Tantric Buddhism as far as China,
Padmasambhava is supposed to have made a trip to Srilanka to obtain 
certain teachings and some ritual objects.
The legend of Barlaam and Joasaphat, which probably goes back to 
a Pahlavi (in use c. 300B. C.-A. D. 800) version, refers to Srilanka and 
The hermit Barlaam (Bhagavan) comes 
is influenced by Vetulla elements.
all the way from Sarandip, which is now Srilanka (Schulz 1981:132). 
Schulz thinks that "the frequent occurrence, in the Christianized story, 
of parables, example, and dialogues found also in the Lalitavistara,

40
makes it probable that this Sanskrit biography was used". (ibid: 136). 
The Lalitavistara is a Vai pulya text. The legend of the four caskets 
(ibid: 139) may be a relic of the Tripitaka and dharani-pitaka. The 
Georgian version Balavari ani says that the king "caught sight of two 
men clad in tattered garments made up from rags salvaged from rubbish 
heaps; and their sallow complexions testified to their poverty and need". 
This is a clear reference to the rag-robed fraternity of the Pamsukulikas 
who were constituents of Abhayagiri (EBu.1.22). Pamsukula are refuse 
rags from a dust heap used for garments by monks (Edgerton 1953: 338 
quotes the word pamsukula from Vai pulya and allied works: Lalitavistara, 
Mahāvastu, Divyavadana, Avadanas ataka).
NORTHWEST INDIA: THE TANGLED REGION OF IRANIAN AND HELLEIC IDEAS
The northwestern frontiers of India, the Uttarapatha of Buddhist 
literature, the udi cya region of silpa texts, was steeped in Iranian 
connections from very ancient times. There are as, esp. Bactria, formed 
spheres of influence as well as ruled territories of the Achaemeni ans, 
Parthians, Indo-Parthians and Sassani ans. The Parthian period deserves 
special notice when the liberal hold of Zoroastrianism led to the 
efflorescence of Buddhism among the East Iranians on the peripheries 
of India,
The Parthi an Arsacid era commences in 247 B. C. The Parthi an 
empire began its expansion around 176-171 B. C. under Phraates I. His
brother Mithradates I (c.171-c.138 B. C.) wrested districts from 
Bucratides of Bactria. The eastern provinces comprised Drangi ana, 
Sakastan and Arachosia, the latter comprising the modern province of 
Kandahar. These provinces were subject to the central government of 
the Parthian king only for limited periods. In Kandahar and Punjab, 
an independent Indo-Parthian_dynasty arose in the first century A. D. 
with its centre at Taxila, The kings had Iranian and peculiarly 
Parthian names. The Indo-Parthian empire came to an end with the Kushan 
invasion in A. D. 78. After an existence of 400 years in Iran, the 
Parthian empire was overthrown by the Sassani ans. The Sassanian dynasty 
was "founded by Ardashir I in A. D. 226 and destroyed by the Arabs in 
637. The dynasty is named after Sasan, an ancestor of Ardashir I" 
(EB.1965: 20.4). Ardashir subdued Seistan (Sakastan), Balkh (Bactria), 
Khwarizm (Chorasmia), etc. Since these territories pertained to the 
Kushan empire, the implication is that he overcame the Kushans (EB.1965: 
17.569)Al-Tabari confirms that the kings of the Kushans, of Turan 
(Quzdar, south of Quetta), and of Makran submitted to victorious 
Ardashir. Among the 27 provinces of the Sassani an empire enumerated 
in the inscription of the Kaaba-e-Zardusht under Shapur I (A. D. 241-272) 
figure: (21) Seistan, (22) Turan, (23) Makran, (25) India (extent 
undefined), (26) Kushanshahr, extending from Peshawar to Tashkent, 
Sogdiana and the borders of Kashgaria (B.1965: 17.570).
The Parthians themselves were the earliest translators of Buddhist 
texts into Chinese. The very first translator was the Parthian prince 
An Shih-kao. Shih-kao means 'lokottara' which is of significance in 
its emphasis on the expanding school, of the Lokottara-vadins who were 
to become the foundation for laterday Esoteric Buddhism.

41
Parthia was known in Chinese as An-si 'Arsak, the Arsacid kingdom 
of Parthia'. An was prefixed to the names of translators from this 
country. An Shih-kao was a royal prince who ceded the kingdom to his 
uncle and became a monk. He came to China in A. D. 148 and worked there 
till A. D. 170 (Nj.ii.4). "The arrival in 148 A. D. of a Parthian mission- 
ary, An Shih-kao at Loyang marked the beginning of a period of intense 
activity"....He is "the first undoubtedly historical personality in 
Chinese Buddhism. It was probably he who initiated the systematical 
translation of Buddhist texts and who organized the first translation 
(Zürcher 
te am.In this respect his importance is indeed very great". 
1972:30, 32).
In A.D. 181 An Hsuan 'Upasaka of An-si' arrived at Loyang, joined 
his countryman An Shih-kao and translated two Buddhist works (Nj.ii.6). 
An Hsuan had come to Loyang as a merchant, and obtained the Chinese 
military title of cavalry commander for specified 'meritorious work'. 
Both worked with a Chinese named Yen Fo-t'iao the first known Chinese 
together with Yen Fo-t'iao the Ugradatta- 
monk, An Hsüan translated 
pari prccha (T 322). This sutra is a summary account of the career of 
a Bodhisattva, and wholly belongs to Mahayana (Zürcher 1972: 34).
An Fa-hsien 'Parthian Dharmabhadra' translated two sutras, including 
the Mahaparinirvanasutra, which were already lost in A.D.730 (Nj.ii.17). 
"The Kao-seng c'huan and later catalogues speak of the two Parthi ans 
T'an (-wu-ti (? Dharmasatya) and An Fa-hsien (? Dharmabhadra). They 
all arrived in or shortly after 250 A.D. at Loyang, which at that time 
still must have been the stronghold of Buddhism in the North". (Zürcher 
1972:55).
The Parthian śramana An Fa-ch'in translated five works at Loyang 
during A. D. 281-306 of which one is the sutra on unlimited changes of 
the supernatural footsteps (Nj 148, ii.25), and the legend of Asoka 
(T 2042), which was destined to play a role in early Chinese Buddhism 
(Zürcher 1972:70).
Besides the Parthians, other Iranian-speaking peoples too were 
active in the transmission of Buddhism to China, like the Yueh-chin 
(Chih), the Khotanese (Yu), and the Sogdians (Kang). The overwhelming 
Chinese evidence is an indication of the devotion of the Eastern Iranians 
to Buddhism and their dedicated missionary activites in China, The
following Yueh-chih were active in translating Buddhist sutras into 
Chinese:

Chih is the ethnikon for Yueh-chih monks. Dharmaraksa (active c. 
266-308) is the greatest Buddhist translator before Kumarajiva (Zürcher 
1972: 65-70). He made Ch'ang-an the major Buddhist centre in Northern 
China. He was "the itinerant preacher, organizer and supervisor" of

42
the Buddhist Order. "Dharmaraksa's translation of the Lotus Sutra 
completed the series of the five Mahayana scriptures which more than 
any other texts were destined to exert a profound influence upon,the 
development of early Chinese Buddhist thought: Prajñāpāramita, Suramgam 
samadhi-sutra, Vimalakirti-nirdeśa, Saddharma-pundarika and Sukhāvati- 
vyuha" (Zürcher 1972:70). Around 400 lived the last Yüeh-chih monk 
Chih T'an-yüeh, who was teacher to Emperor Hsiao-wu (reigned 373-397). 
He introduced a new way of chanting Buddhist verse which became very 
popular (Zürcher 1972: 144, also 23, 24, 32, 36, 47-51, 54, 55, 61).
The nexus of the Iranian Welt-anschauung and Buddhism gave rise 
to the Sumeru, the mandala corresponding to the cosmocratic cities of 
the Pre-Achaemeni an Ecbatana and the Parthian Ctesiphon, etc., the 
centrality of fire cult of the Zoroastrians helped the emergence of 
home in vajrayana, the sun-God Mithra was Vairocana the Great Sun 
(Dai-nichi in Japanese). Lamotte (1954: 392) goes to the length of saying 
that Khotan was, if not the cradle, at any rate the stronghold of the 
mahayanist movement (this statement begins the introduction to The 
Khotanese Surangama-samadhi-sutra, by R.E. Emmerick, London 1970, xiii).
In Shingon or the Japanese tradition of Vajrayana, there are thirty 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who are sacred to thirty days of the month. 
One deity is sacred to one day of the month. They are known as Sanjuri ch 
hi-butsu "Buddhas (butsu) sacred (hi) to thirty (sanju) days (nichi". 
They are illustrated in a fascicule preserved at the Kanchi-in Hall of 
the Toji monastery at Kyoto. They are reproduced in the Taisho Zuzo 
(=TZ) that is the section of illustrations of the Taishō edition of the 
Chinese Tripitaka (TZ.104: 5.745) under the title of Sanju-nichi-hi- 
butsu-zu "illustrations of Buddhas sacred to thirty days". The names 
of the Thirty Buddhas are given below, alongwith their symbolic syllables 
(bija) and Chinese names. It may be noted that the names begin with 
the Buddha symbolising the 'Light of Dhyana', followed by Dipajyoti 
Buddha or 'Buddha of the Light of the Lamp'. The sixth Buddha symbolises 
the 'Light of Two Myriad (=20, 000) Lamps No sequence can be discerned 
in the names. The letter A is the symbolic syllable of four Buddhas of 
the 1,3,10, 27 days. Another scroll entitled Mandara-shu (shuji) 
'collection of bija-mandalas at the Ninnaji monastery, Kyoto gives the 
thirty bijas of the same Thirty Buddhas of the month (Iz.103.48).

The adoration of the Thirty Buddhas is supposed to be a Japanese 
custom (Hobōgirin 197). So far no parallel to them could be adduced. 
They are a part of the traditions of North-West India that had been 
transmitted via Serindia to China and thence to Korea and Japan. The 
heritage of Gandhara still survives in the living memories of Bast 
Asian monks. During a visit to Korea in 1981, my companion monk told 
me that their robes of daily wear are of Gandhara origin. The trousers 
worn by the monk strongly recalled Kuṣaṇa trousers and the modern salwar 
worn in Afghanistan. Though vajrayana disappeared entirely from China, 
it was preserved in its minutest details in Japan. The worship of 
the Thirty Buddhas of the month must have reached from North-West India 
to East Asia where it has survived to this day in Japan.
It was natural for the Buddhist monks of North-West India and 
Eastern Iran to adjust to the prevailing customs to make Buddhism a 
religion of the people. In this way a number of popular practises 
were adopted in a changed form into Buddhism by giving them a Buddhist 
garb beyond recognition.
The custom of invoking each day of the month too derives from 
the Zoroastrian practises prevalent in the Udicya region. In the minor 
texts of Avesta there are two Sirozahs the greater and the lesser, 
which in their 30 paragraphs invoke in turn the divinities of each day 
of the month, and which are recited especially on the thirtieth day 
after the death of a Zoroastrian" (ERE, 2269) They are termed siroza 
yast (sh thirty', roz 'day', Avesta sih ročak). The yašt (Av. yešti 
worship by praise) praise and glorify the divinities in the sequence 
in which they are used to name the days of the month" (ERE. 2.268b).
The thirty days are named below in Avesta (after Wolff), and Pahlavi, 
with their meanings according to MacKenzie.

Though no precise equations of the Avestan and Buddhist lists 
can be worked out, the general idea of worshipping the divinities of 
the thirty days of the month is of Iranian origin. The name of the 
Buddha of the first day 'Light of Dhyana' recalls Daena (Pahlavi den) 
<Skt. dhyana, the 24th day of the Avestan month. The Avestan Anay-
ranam Raočan ham 'Infinite Light reminds us of Amitabha (15th day), 
but more of the sixth day with its "Buddha of the Lights of Twenty 
Thousand Lamps". The Abhayandada of the 22nd day echoes Avestan Raman 
'Peace' (21st day). A detailed comparison of the Japanese and Avestan 
rituals may elucidate further.
Ancient Indian "geographers place the Uttarapatha division of 
Bharatavarsa or Kumari dvipa between the Eastern Punjab and the Oxus". 
(Sircar 1973:1)
The role of the Udicya regions came to the fore during the lifetime 
of Lord Buddha himself. The first lay devotees Trapusa-Bhallika hailed 
from Bactria (Lokesh Chandra 1979:1-10).
In his Indian campaign "Alexander captured the towns of Ora (or, 
Nora) and Bazira (the people of which repaired to the impregnable hili- 
fort of Aornos on the Indus) and finally Aornos (modern Una)-all in 
the territory of the Assacenoi in the present Swat and Buner", (Sircar 
1973: 21). Is Bazira cognate to vajra? The term Vajrayana is recorded 
rather late in the Sadhanamala 225.10 by Edgerton. The word vajra in

The
Vajrayana may embody the Iranian connotation of buzurg, vuzurg 'elders, 
ancestors' referring to the reinstatement of ancient pre-Buddhist ideas, 
though in a changed garb, within the syndrome of Buddhist development, 
thus constituting a unique (vi-tula) step. This principle was an 
essential element in the evolution of the Tantras. Hindu deities were 
introduced in the Tantras. For instance, the Garbhadhatu and Vajradhātu 
mandalas have Hindu deities in their exterior enceintes.

assimilation of native deities into Buddhism in referred to as the 
honji-suijaku theory, in which the indigenous Japanese deities are the 
manifestations (suijaku) of the true nature (honji) of the various 
Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Mrs. Alicia Matsunaga (1969) has traced the 
rise and development of the theory of assimilation from Early Buddhism 
onwards in her fascinating work The Buddhist Philosophy of Assimilation. 
Accretion was a constant process in ever-developing Vajrayana. 
The Vai pulya texts, with their emphasis on Light, became mantrayana 
with the addition of dharanis and mantras. They gained a philosophic 
base by correlation to the four siddhantas: Vaibhaṣikas kriya tantra, 
Sautrantika: carya tantra, Yogacaras Yoga tantra, Madhyami kas anuttara- 
yoga tantra (Lessing/Wayman 1978: introd.2). This integration and 
enrichment was so overwhelming in its verbiage so as to overshadow the 
original basic features.
The Governor of Asoka in Surastra was an Iranian: Tusaspa (Sircar 
1973:50). "The prestige of the Udicya-Brahmanas, 1.e. the Brahmanas 
of Uttarapatha, is generally recognised in the early works of Pali 
literature and that there is reference to the great social prestige of 
the Udicya-Brahmanas settled in Kasi and Magadha". (Sircar 1973: 56). 
Sircar goes to the extreme length of saying that the era of 58 B. C. 
commemorates the founding of an independent Parthian kingdom in East 
Iran by Vonones after the decline of the Imperial Parthian hold on the 
outlying eastern provinces. The era travelled from Panjab to the 
Malavas in Rajasthan and was later termed the Vikrama Samvat (Sircar 
1973: 58).
Weiner (1976 353) points out the possibility of the introduction 
of the pralambapada Buddha around the fifth century at Ajanta from 
the NW. The pralambapada asana came into use for cult images in Gandhara 
from the 3rd to 4th centuries. The colossal image in cave XVI at 
Ajanta sits on a lion throne, unlike the shrine images in caves I and 
II seated on a throne adorned with cakra and deer. He is the Sakyasinhas 
"Buddhist scriptures describe the king or emperor as a lion; at his 
accession, he roars like a lion; he sits on a lion throne, and dies 
on a lion couch. The Buddha inherits all royal attitudes, and is 
hailed as the Sakyan lion, (Mahavansa VI)".
Its
"The lion throne has historically and traditionally throughout 
the Near East been associated with royalty and divine power. 
antecedents in India go back to the portrait of Vima Kadphises.
There
is little doubt that in time the attributes of the king were transferred 
to the Buddha and that the symbols of royalty associated with divine 
and cosmological authority were adapted to the representation of the 
Buddha image".

47
"Undoubtedly, the utilization of the lion throne without the deer 
and cakra, coinciding as it does with the royal posture of the Buddha, 
as opposed to that of the ascetic, represents a new or at least different 
conception of the Buddha from that represented in the shrines of caves 
I, II and others". (Weiner 1976 354).
The bhadrasana is typical of Maitreya. He is the Buddha of the 
Future who will come down to the earth from his Tuşita heaven to 
establish the dharma. Asanga is supposed to have been initiated into 
the Tantras by Maitreya. He may be on a throne supported by lions. 
He sits with legs pendent in Europe an fashion. His sitting posture 
derived from Iranian and Hellenic royalty, points to his NW origins. 
The word Maitreya itself can be a metamorphosis of Mitra, Iranian 
Mithra 'Sun'. Bhadrasana can refer to the mode of sitting prevalent 
in Bhadra or Bactria. Bhadra can be a Sanskritisation of Bhallaka < 
Bahlika. Bhallaka, lit. from the Bhalla people, is a kind of copper, 
enumerated under the eight pisaca lohani or metals from the Pisaca 
country, in the Vibhanga Commentary 63: Puskalavati and adjacent regions 
were known for the quality of their steel. Modern Hindi bhala 'lance, 
spear' is derived from bhallaka, The paradise of Maitreya Tusita can 
be an intentional camoflage of Tusara. "The city of Balkh in Tukhāra 
was built by an ancient king of Persia called Gushtasp" (Tuan Ch'eng- 
shih, c. A. D. 800-863, translated by Waley 1952:171). Tusita-kayi ko 
devaputro in Mahavastu 3,345.16, and in Lalitavistara 124.12, 183.17, 
363.21 associate Tuşita with kings (devaputra). When the Zooastrian 
heritage was destroyed by Alexander in 330B. G., the cultural gap in 
Iran found its replenishment in the light of Sakyamuni's dharma. The 
time-honoured traditions and thoughts of Iran shimmered at different 
levels of existence and consciousnes in the new incarnation of 
Buddhism.
The Visnu-dharmottara Purana, compiled as early as the sixth 
century A. D., describes the garments of Dhanada Kubera as that of a 
northerner (udicva-vesa).
Indeed that Gandhara provided the prototype for both sculptures 
becomes evident if we compare them with typical Gandharan representations 
of so-called Pañchika...Frequently, in such reliefs, the male is 
dressed in the Scythian attire, complete with boots or sandals, and 
holds in his hands both the spear and a bag". (Pal 1977:15)
"Some time during the Kushana period, there appeared in northwest 
India the Persian god of wealth and fortune, Pharro. On being adopted 
into the Indian pantheon, he was perhaps, given the name Vaisravana, 
but a number of his foreign traits were retained, especially in the 
Buddhist pantheon".
"Such synthesis or amalgamation is a characteristic feature of 
the iconography of the Kushana period, especially in northwest India. 
Several initially different deities, embodying conceptually related 
ideas--both foreign and indigenous--became synthesized into many of 
the major divinities of the puranic pantheon".
"Finally, it is obvious that the compiler of the Vishnudharmottara 
Purana, at least of the third Khanda, was more than familiar with the 
image type of Dhanada-Kubera prevalent in northwest India. Both R. C. 
Hazra and P. Shah have suggested that the text may have been redacted 
somewhere in that region. ...if the text was not redacted in the north-

48
west, certainly one of the compilers must have belonged to that region". 
(Pal 1977:26)
A Gandhara fragment of a frieze with five laymen, dating probably 
to the third quarter of the first century A. D., is one of the earliest 
reliefs particularly reminiscent of Roman reliefs from the early Imperial 
times. It comes closest in style to the representation of the apotheosis 
of Augustus in Ravenna. It shows that Gandhara artists must have been 
acquainted with the art of Rome (Ackermann 1975.9, 50-51).
Soper in his paper on 'Aspects of light symbolism in Gandharan 
sculpture points out parallels to the "Visit" stelae of Gandhara and 
Kucha style caves with the cult monuments of Mithra in the late Roman 
empire (1949: 260). He sees striking similarities in composition and 
style between Gandharan and forms spread by Roman legions of Tauroctony 
by which Mithra was worshipped in his secret sanctuaries. He cites S. 
Levi about the plausibility of Maitreya Ajita having an Irani an origin 
in Mithra Invictus.
"Specific evidence shows, however, that no matter how widely and 
from whatever sources sun and fire symbolism was infused into Buddhist 
iconography, its most consistent and strongest manifestations occurred 
in the Northwest, in the region that was also penetrated by Iranian 
influence. It is on a coin of Kanişka that the standing Buddha was 
first presented with an aureole of light about his whole body, like the 
sun-god". (Soper 1950:72).
"The process of suffusing the Buddha idea with light symbolism 
reaches its climax in the "Sutra of the Sea of Mystic Ecstasy". which 
I have ascribed to the Hadda region. The re almost every other value, 
ethical or metaphyysical, has been drowned out in a blaze of light; 
and the Tathāgata is imagined as something like an enormous electrical 
display, acting only by the emission of rays that cross the universe". 
(Soper 1950:73).
"The Matangi-sutra, also, is important as a predecessor of Vajrayana 
magical formulas. This sutra, translated into Chinese in the third 
century, was most likely compiled in Samarkand
astronomical informations". (Nakamura 1980: 318) Judging from its 
translated by the Parthi an An Shih-kao during A. D. 148-170 (K 759, Nj 
The Matangi-sutra was 
643, T 551). It was translated thrice over again in A. D. 230 by Chu 
Lü-yen and Chih-ch'ien (K766, Nj 645, T 1300), in A.D. 307-313 by 
Dharmaraksa (K 765, Nj 646, T 1301), and in A.D. 317-420 by an unknown 
translator (K 762, Nj 644, T 552). This sutra has been translated by 
Beal, Buddhist Literature in China, pp.166-170.
As late as the eleventh century, Hbrom-ston (A. D. 1005-1064) the 
chief disciple of Atisa, speaks of a Kusana princess in a far-off 
Demon-land (Schwieger 1978:16), as an incarnation of Tara, in a work 
on rebirth in Sukhavati the western paradise of Amitabha. Bhallaka 
was one of the pisaca metals: Bactria was thus a pisaca-or demon-land 
(see above p. 47).
In the tangled region of NW India cultural elements from various 
lands fused into Buddhism. These syncretised trends travelled to Central 
Asia. A double-headed Buddha was found from the Temple of the Helmeted, 
Kizil. It has been dated to the 7th century A. D. (Bhattacharya 1977: 
50 pl.12). It bears five lines in Tocharian on the reverse. Tocharian
is akin to Latin, Greek, Germanic: for example the word for new is nu

49
or okso means an ox (Waley 1952: 19n. 1). The European context of 
Tocharian indicates that double-faced image of the Buddha may be associate 
with (pre-)Roman models. Madame Dr. Magdalina Stancheva, has excavated 
a double-headed portrait-statue from a Roman villa in Sofia which she 
dates to about the 3rd/4th century A. D.
The role of NW regions in the foundation of Mahayana has been
discussed at length by Lamotte (1954: 389-396). The Mahayana sūtras 
were hidden for centuries. They were discovered in Kusana times.

Sadaprarudi ta found the Prajña in Gandhara in the city of Gandhavati, 
written on gold leaves with melted beryl, sealed with seven seals, and 
locked up in a precions casket. This statement has a parallel in the 
Iranian tradition that Zoroastrian scriptuhes were preserved with loving 
care under the Achaemeni ans. King Vishtaspa had the original copy of 
the Avesta written in letters of gold and deposited in the 'Stronghold 
tr Records at Persepolis (Tabari 5. The Dinkart 3.3, 7.7.3 says that 
a sumptuous copy was conserved in the Treasury of Shapigan at Persepolis. 
Another copy inscribed on golden tablets was preserved in the treasury 
of the fire-temple at Samarkand, Both these archetype copies were 
destroyed in the invasion of Alexander in 330 B. C. when he put to fire 
the Falace at Persepolis and when he razed Samarkand to the ground 
(ERE.2.267).
THE DEIFICATION OF KINGS AS A SUBSTRATUM FOR AMITABHA AND
VAIRO CANA
The deification of kings was a solemn act of legislation in Greece 
even before Alexander crossed over into Asia: "the deification of rulers 
was a peculiar manifestation of this theopoetic faculty in this (if in 
nothing else), that it was not a sculptor's or a painter's fancy but 
a solemn act of legislation, and that rulers specifically were its 
objects.
"When a foreign ruler appeared, vested with the authority due 
theoretically to the man of super-eminent ability, a place was ready 
made for him, and it was a place in the ranks of the gods. Here, then,
in the sphere of politics a special reason existed for the indulgence 
of what we have called the theopoetic faculty of the Greeks, a reason, 
moreover, that was operative in epochs of political speculation and 
advanced constitutionalism like those in which deification of rulers 
was first established in Greece and first transplanted to Rome". (CAH. 
7.13-14)
"In the regions of Asia where a theory of the state had been 
evolved, Alexander, like the Persian kings whom he had succeeded, was 
not a god but the chosen of the gods. He was for the Persians a being 
endowed by the supreme Light-God, Ahuramazda, with his spirit; hence 
with a peculiar glory (hvareno), an indwelling light from which issued 
a radiance so brilliant as to dazzle ordinary men. But he was not the 
object of an official cult. In Asia deities either were, or were 
tending to become, cosmic forces, while their worshippers, unlike the 
Greeks, remained devoutly religious". (CAH. 7.14-15).
"What lay behind these repeated acts of deification was doubtless 
the same motive which led the Sami ans and Alexander to the idea in the 
first instance--political convenience and political thought. The same 
political problem presented itself again and again: the need of finding 
a legal basis in a constitutional state for an extra-constitutional 
authority. As kings, Antigonus and his rivals had no right to interfere 
with a free city; as gods, they had the right to make known their wishes 
and their worshippers the duty to regard them. 
grounds states experienced no difficulty in the discovery of new gods 
On purely scientific

51
or in the recognition of old gods under new names; nor was there anyone 
to dispute the right of the organized community to adopt new gods once 
it had discovered them". (CAH. 7.16)
"Ptolemy II (285-246 B. C.) and Arsinoe, his sister-wife and consort, 
already lifted above ordinary mortals through being the children of 
the 'Saviour Gods!, shared a temple with Alexander as the 'Brother- 
Sister Gods', in the cult established by Ptolemy I. Thus by his own 
fiat a living ruler raised himself to a place by the side of the 
archegetes of empire as the divine object of the homage of his subjects, 
as the extra-constitutional authority whose will was everywhere law-- 
a symbol of the common fealty to one head of diverse elements in the 
papulation of the kingdom". (CAH. 7.17)
Pharaoh was not Law incarnate (nómos émpsuchos), like the 
Hellenistic god-king; he was rather the apotheosis of Life--the Osiris. 
of the living". (CAH. 7.19). Compare Amitayus 'Infinite Life in Buddhism.. 
"In 290 B. C. the Athenians hailed Demetrius as a true god, not 
one of wood or stone'...King-worship altered its forms with alterations 
in the organization of states, its nature with alterations in the 
conception of God". (CAR. 7.22)
"Though the status of the provinces varied they were effectively 
attached to Rome by the veneration which they felt for the person of 
the Emperor, whom they were prepared to treat as a god. It has been 
shown elsewhere that the practice of offering divine honours to Augustus 
began in the East soon after Actium and in the course of his reign 
penetrated to all parts of the Empire". (CAH. 10. 209-210)
I would like to refer my readers to L. R. Taylor, The Divinity of 
the Roman Emperor (Middletown, Conn. 1931, Amer. Philol. Association) 
and to K. Scott, The significance of statues in precious metals in 
Emperor-worship (Trans. Amer. Philol. Assoc. 62/1931.1af).
The continued political presence of the Achaemeni ans, Parthians, 
Seleucids, Indo-Greeks, and Kusanas had a far-reaching impact on the 
cultural hegemony of Northwest India. It saw the osmosis of Iranian/ 
Hellenistic ideas into Buddhism. As we have shown above the Greeks 
followed the Iranians in king-cults or emperorworship. When they 
embraced Buddhism, their kings were apotheosised as the Buddha. The
distinctive portrait-like personalised features in Gandhara statues 
are an evidence that actual personages were immortalised as divine 
statues. In this connection we may note the observations of Kiyota:
"Alexander's expedition to northwest India (327-325 B. C. ) left a 
great impact upon the development of Indian Buddhist thought. A Greek 
colony referred to as Yavana was established in Bactria in the late 
third century B. C. It contributed to the development of Greco-Gandharan 
art at about the beginning of the Christian century. This art depicted 
the Buddha anthropomorphically and gave rise to the cult of deification, 
and subsequently to the concept of the enlightened body as eternal, 
transcending the historical Buddha. This is not saying that the cult 
of deification was completely absent in the preceding period. ... 
Nevertheless the depiction of the Buddha anthropomorphically represents 
the concretization of the Buddha as an eternal enlightened body, 
transcending the historical Sakyamuni". (Kiyota 1978: 10-11)
In the syndrome of apotheosis, the descendant kings must have been shocked to see their mighty royal predecessors, founders of

52
kingdoms, as Sakyamuni Buddha robed in the attire of mendicant monks 
with shaven heads, and bereft of imposing moustaches. It is inter- 
esting that moustaches are found in Central Asian statues of the Buddha 
whence they were transmitted to China, This imperative must have 
become a royal contribution to monastic Buddhism, wherein Sakyamuni 
the Sage of the Sakyas emerged as Sakyasimha 'the Lion of the Sakyas', 
from a human monk to a divinised being in all divine (lokottara) glory 
(farah). In fact, in Thailand we find images of the bejewelled and 
crowned Buddha, as a king in his royal costume, the Buddha paré. 
"The practice was reinforced by the concept of the Buddha as universal 
emperor (cakravartin), and the Mahayana theory of transcendental 
Buddha... The Khmer crowned Buddha image made its first appearance 
at the beginning of the 12th century A. D. at Phimai, the sanctuary 
dedicated to Tantric Buddhism" (Krairiksh 1979:132). "From the time 
of this example onward, crowned Buddha images were created not to 
represent the Mahayana transcendental Buddha, but Sakyamuni dressed 
as rajadhi raiaKing of Kings. According to the legend of Jambupati, 
a certain king of that name had such high esteem of himself that he 
would not listen to the teaching of the Master. So the Buddha mani- 
fested himself as rajadhiraja and summoned Jambupati to visit him. 
The latter, awestruck by the splendour of the scene before him, was 
not slow to pay obeisance to the Buddha especially when he saw a chasm 
open before him issuing fire. He was converted to Buddhism and became 
a disciple. The existence of a Lân Na-style bronze figurine from the 
16th century A.D. inscribed with the name of King Maha Jambu attests 
to the popularity of the Jambupati legend during this period (see 
Griswold 1961: 295-296)" (ibid. 154).
The rolefkings in the new development in Buddhism can be seen in 
the origin of Amitabha. In the Larger Sukhavati-vyuha the Buddha 
relates that Loke svararaja was 81st in a line of Tathāgatas beginning 
with Dipankara. Monk Dharmakara resolved in the presence of Loke svara- 
raja to become a Buddha. Dharmakara spent five kalpas in meditation. 
Finally he reigns in Sukhavati as Amitabha (EB. 1.434). It seems to 
idealise a real historic fact of a powerful king (Lokesvara-raja), 
who because of his having followed a religion of Light (Dipankara), 
requested the monk Dharmakara to formulate and systematise a new cult 
of Infinite Light (Amitabha). It was a sublimation of the cult of 
royalty as well. The king symbolised the world of light as represent- 
ed by the Sun, and he resided in a royal citadel with 5-7 ramparts: 
both elements become the dominant focus in the emergence of Amitabha 
and later on of Vairocana. These phenomenal developments have been 
dealt with in subsequent discussions. The emphasis on the religion 
of Light so clear in Zoroastrianism and its earthly expression in the 
farmah of the king--brought into being a new tradition in NW Indian 
Buddhism which was un-paralleled (vi-tula) in the Indian heartland 
itself. This was propounded in Vaitulya texts, later designated 
Tantras. The word vi-tula was uncommon, if not unknown, in Indic 
Sanskrit. The more prevalent form was a-tula. Hence it was soon 
mistaken for vipula 'extensive' and it original significance was 
forgotten, even in Pali where vetulla continued in use. The negative 
prefix vi reflected its popularity in the Iranian languages, where to 
this day it is a living prefix bi-din one who lacks religion'. 
Its use was natural to the NW region. Thus arose Tantric Buddhism in

53
NW India in a grand effort of legitimation of kingship through Buddhism 
We have historic evidence of the eighth century that Vairocana 
did symbolise empirium. In Japan, emperor Shomu issued a rescript in 
A. D. 743 ordering the construction of the gigantic statue (daibutsu) 
of Vairocana, 16 metres in height, at the Todaiji monastery in his 
attempt to unify the nation in an awareness of its power, as an 'apt 
symbol of the emperor as the controlling head of the state' (Kobayashi 
1975: 22), as an especially valuable political and religious symbol' 
(Kobayashi 1975: 25) to consolidate the sovereignty of the nation in a 
harmony of the emperor and his people on the deeper spiritual levels 
of a shared awareness: it was a 'Grand National Temple'. When the 
old capital at Nara was abandoned and a new capital was established 
at Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) in A. D. 794, the Toji temple was an integral 
part of the metropolitan masterplan. It was "intended to invoke the 
protection of the divinities and thereby to assure the peace and 
prosperity" (Sawa 1972:130) oftkingdom. It was placed in charge of 
Kōbō daishi himself, the great master who introduced Shingon Buddhism 
with its central deity of Vairocana. The temple was significantly 
termed Kyō-o-gokoku-ji temple for the protection of the state'; which 
popularly came to be known as the Toji (to-east, ji-temple) as it was 
built on the east side of the city gate.
The Buddhist sutras were the sanctifying power of the State, 
revitalising sovereignty, stabilising the state and ensuring the well- 
being of the Ruler. In Japan the ceremony chingo-kokka was to protect 
the country by the power of Buddhism. These were chingo-kokka-no 
sambu or three sutras for the protection of the state, namely: 
) Saddharmapundari ka-sutra (Jap. Hoke kyo, Chin. Fa-hua-ching 
Karuni ka-raja-sutra (Jap. Ninno-gyo, Chin. Jên-wang-ching) 
Suvarna-prabhasa-sutra (Jap. Konkomyo-kyo, Chin. Chin-kuang-ming-ching) 
The Karuni ka-raja-sutra was translated as early as A. D. 402-409 
by Kumarajiva (K 19). It is a prajñāpāramita-sutra on a benevolent 
king who protects his country (Nj 17). It was re-translated by 
Amoghavajra in A. D. 765 (K 1340, Nj 965), who further wrote a commen- 
tary (Nj 1406) as well as its ritual (Nj 1419, 1435). Visser (1935) 
has detailed the state ceremonies of this sutra that were performed 
by Japanese Emperors over the centuries.
Hsüan-tsang said in A. D. 657 to the Chinese Emperor that all the 
six hundred scrolls he had translated were "regarded in their land 
of origin as contributing to 'national defence." (Waley 1952: 121,124). 
In the Garbhadhātu mandala there is a special form of Samkusumita- 
raja used in the January rite for the protection of the Emperor (Esot. 
12).
Prajña and Munisri translated the Shou hu kuo chieh chu t'o-10- 
守護國界主陀羅尼經
ni ching in A. D. 790 (K 1384, N1 9781
T. 997). It is expressly with the idea of protecting the state.
extolls dharanis for protecting kings and was esteemed in Japan (Naka- 
mura 1980326-7 and references therein to the idea of the "Protection 
of the State"). My paper "The role of Tantras in the defence stra- 
tegy of T'ang China" details the interdependence of the state and 
the sutras in East Asia.
Vairocana as the Universal Monarch or Ekaksara Cakravartin Vairo- 
cana represents the state, empirium or universal dominion. In this

54
form he is known as Ekākṣara Cakravartin (Jap. Ichiji Kinrin). Ichiji 
Kinrin is rendered into Sanskrit also as Ekakşara Uşnişacakra. His 
supreme mantra or ekakṣara is BHRUM. He is the sovereign of sover- 
eigns, the supreme (usnisa) cakra (vartin). He has two forms: Sakya 
Cakravartin (Shaka-kinrin) and Vairocana Cakravartin (Dainichi-kinrin). 
As Sakya-Cakravartin he holds the cakra (wheel in the bowlbearing 
mudra (Huntington 1975: 150). In Tibetan he is the Sakyasimha, the 
Sarvavid Vairocana. In ordinary rites, Vairocana Cakravartin is wor- 
shipped in the jñana-muşti. His samaya symbol is the eight-spoked wheel (for details see Mochizuki 1.140-141).
Ekakṣara Cakravartin is illustrated in several Japanese 
with the seven jewels (sapta-ratna) of a universal pantheons, 
monarch: wheel 
(cakra), wish-granting jewel (cintamani), horse, elephant, queen, 
general, and minister, for instance, in the Shoson-zuzo by Shinkaku 
(A. D. 1117-1180, TZ. 88.7), in the Collection of Kakuzen drawn by him 
between A. D. 1183-1213 (TZ.102. 62, 64), in the Mandara-shu 'collection 
of mandalas compiled by Konen and copied in A. D. 1187 (TZ. 98 fig.7, 8), in Asabasho compiled by Shocho (A.D. 1205-1282), and in several 
other pantheons of Shingon. This confirms the integral association of Vairocana and the State. Vairocana Cakravartin is illustrated
below:

Till modern times, the role of astrology in politics cannot be 
understimated. Col. Meadows Taylor has assigned the foremost place 
to the astrological forecast in the Rising of 1857 to overthrow the 
British power in India. The interpretive essay of Bardwell L. Smith 
on "Kingship, the Sangha and the process of legitimation in Anuradha- 
pura Ceylon" (in Bechert 1978:100-126) affirms the historical and 
cosmic dimensions of legitimation in a system of values transcending 
authority.
Buddha the Cosmocrator, attired in princely jewellery, with a 
crown on his head, has been studied by Paul Mus, Le Buddha paré, Son 
origine indienne. Cakyamuni dans le mahayani sme moyen (BEFEO 28/1928: 
153-278), and by Y. Krishan, The origin of the crowned Buddha image, 
Bast and West 21 (1971): 91-96. The colossal images of the Buddha at 
Bamiyan were adorned with jewellery and ornamental chains (Beal 1884: 
114).
AMITABHA
The nomenclature and legends of Amitabha are of seminal relevance 
for understanding the origin and development of a powerful tradition 
which was to be christened later on as the Tantras. This evolution 
is enshrined in the fourfold division of the Tantras themselves into 
Kriya, Carya, Yoga and Anuttara-yoga Tantras. Each division had its 
central Tathagata. Amitabha is the central Tathāgata of the first 
division of Kriya Tantras. It means that he represents the first step 
in the emergence of the Tantras. He is the earliest crystallisation 
of the Vai pulya denomination.
The cult of Amitabha represents transcendental tendencies in 
Buddhism. Sakyamuni the Man was replaced by Amitabha. His historic 
Enlightenment was transcended into Supreme Enlightenment whose illumi- 
nation became the new dynamised centre reflected in the new Tathagata 
Amitabha. The distant corridors of etymology provide treasured links 
that are missing in explicit statements. "There's many, a story in the 
miniature of a single word!" (Bachelard 1969:179). Sakyamuni was 
flanked by Brahma and Sakra. But when Sakyamuni became Amitabha, the 
attendant acolytes changed names: Brahma became Avalokitesvara and 
Sakra became Mahasthamaprapta. Brahma is the mantra-drasta 'Seer of 
Mantras' who in the new terminology was Avalokita seer of+svara 
'Word, Logos'. The form Avalokitasvara is actually found in Central 
Asi an manuscripts. The Sino-Japanese Kwannon is kwan see¹+on 'sound', 
a translation of Avalokita-svara. Sakra means 'The Powerful One' 
(sak to be powerful), and so also maha 'great' +sthama 'power, 
stamina'+prapta attained'. The metamorphoses of Brahma and Sakra 
will be elaborated in a separate article by the author. Thus we see 
a deliberate effort to change the external morphology of an emerging 
form of Buddhism, and to emphasize its unceasing development within 
a specific circle of time and space, in a Weltanschauung where Euri- 
dika or Light as well as Mithra or Sun were centuries-old symbols. 
Thus the new Buddha was the Buddha of Infinite Light.

56
Amitabha is the light that outshines other Buddhas. Many of his 
epithets concern light. Wu-liang-shou-ching-Larger Sukhavati-vyuha 
translated by Sanghavarman into Chinese in the middle of the third 
century A. D. gives his twelve attributes:
1.The Buddha of Infinite Light (Ch. Wu-li ang-kuang fu)
2. The Buddha of Boundless Light (Ch. Wu-pien-kuang fu)
3.The Buddha of All-pervasive Light (Ch. Wu-ai-kuang fu) 
4.The Buddha of Incomparable Light (Ch. Wu-tui-kuang fu)5.The Buddha of the Light of the Flame's King (Ch. Yen-wang-kuang
fu)
6.The Buddha of Pure Light (Ch. Ching-ching-kuang fu) 
7.The Buddha of Joyful Light (Ch. Huan-hsi-kuang fu) 
8.The Buddha of Wisdom's Light (Ch. Chih-hui-kuang fu) 
9.The Buddha of Unceasing Light (Ch. Pu-Tuan-kuang fu) 
10.The Buddha of Unthinkable Light (Ch. Nan-ssu-kuang fu) 
11.The Buddha of Inexpressible Light (Ch. Wu-ch'eng-kuang fu) 12. The Buddha of the Light that outshines the Sun and Moon 
(Ch. Ch'ao-jih-yüeh kuang fu)
Because the Buddha in thus associated with light in twelve ways he 
is called 'The Buddha of the Twelve Lights'. Compare the Twelve 
Jyotirlingas of Saivism. The twelve lights represent the twelve 
months. The T'ang translation by Bodhi ruci in A. D. 713 (Wu-liang-shou- 
ju-lai-hui) has the twelve epithets, sometimes in different Chinese 
renderings (EBu. 1.441, 450).
Vasubandhu, in his Amitayus-sutra-upadeśa, calls Amitabha 'Tatha- gata of the Light unhindered in the Ten Directions'. T'an-luan (A. D. 476-542) calls him 'Inconceivable Light' (EBu.1.442) in his Hymn of Praise. 
Kōbō Daishi (A. D. 774-835) says in his work Hizōki: Amrta-Tejoraāja 
Tathāgata is the Buddha of Infinite Life in the western quarter (EBu.1.442). The first element amṛta is from the Shih kan-lu chou 
Ten amrta dharani of Amitabha which was translated into Chinese 
for the first time by Gunabhadra in A. D. 468. It has ten epithets 
for Amitabha beginning with amṛta or 
new deity immortality. It was to give the 
Amitabha the reality of a-mrta or eternity. Besides, the word amrta refers to the sun. In the two Nepalese Mudra Manuscripts 
1.10, 251, 4.207 the mudra of Amṛtaprabha precedes that of Candra- prabha in all the three occurrences. Here Amrtaprabha stands for Suryaprabha. The word amrta connotes a ray of light in Raghuvansa 
10.59 (MW. ). Thus Amrta means the Sun. The influence of the worship of the Sun or Mithra can thus be discerned in the evolution of 
Ami tabha. Tejoraja is the central deity of the Sarva-durgati-pari- Sodhana-Tejo rajasya...kalpah (Toh. 483,485), one of the most important of the Yoga Tantras. It shows the continuity of the development from Amitabha to Tejoraja to Vairocana,
Amitabha strongly reminds us of the prominence of light in 
Iranian 
cosmology. "It was Ahura Mazda who in the beginning filled the blessed realms (xvara) with light (Yasna 31.7), and in the realms of light (raocebis) beatitude will be beheld by him whose 
that (
glorify 30.1), while the light of the sun is one of the thought 
. is 
Ahura Mazda (Yasna 1.11). Apart from the passage 
already

57
noted, darkness (temah) is mentioned only once in the Gathas, in Yasna 
31, 20, where it refers to the blackness of hell.
"In the Younger Avesta the dualism between light and darkness 
appears in full vigour, so that Spiegel is amply justified (2. 20ff.) 
in dividing his discussion of the Irani an theology and demonology into 
'the light side' and 'the dark side' respectively. A phrase which 
constantly recurs in beginning the laudation of all good deities is 
'for his magnificence and his glory'... Light was created by Ahura 
Mazda (Yasna 5.1, 37.1), and is one of his prerogatives (Yasna 12.1); 
hence prayer is made to behold the creative light of the creative 
Creator (Yasna 58.6), and the light of the sun praises him (Yasna 64. 6). 
Together with Asha, Ahura Mazda created 'the shining light and sunny 
abo des' (Yt. 3.1 f.), so that the abode 3 of Asha are light (Yasna 16.7). 
..Indeed, 'light' (raocão) is a synonym for 'heaven' (Yasna 19.6), 
another synonym being the shining house of praise' (raoxšna garō- 
nmana, It.10.124, 19.44) to which worship is paid (Sih rocak 2.30).
"Turning to the Pahlavi texts, we are told that the region of 
light is the place of Auharmazd, which they call "endless light" 
(Bundahisn 1.2), and that the place of the Amesha Spentas is 'in that 
best existence of light (Datistan-1-Dinik 74.2)." (Louis H. Gray, 
ERE. 8.61).
The Larger Sukhavati-vyuha is set forth by Sakyamuni to a question 
by Ananda. The Buddha relates that there was a line of 81 Tathāgatas 
beginning with Dipankara and ending with Lokesvararāja.
In the period 
of Lokesvararaja, Dharmakara a king turned monk resolves to become a 
Buddha. Dharmakara meditates and reappears before Lokesvararāja. 
He describes at length the land of bliss or Sukhavati in his 48 vows. 
All the details are related by Sakyamuni,to Ananda who the reupon asks 
the present where abouts of Dharmakara. Sakyamuni, replies that he is 
"The Sakyamuni then 
reigning in Sukhāvati as Buddha Amitabha. 
proceeds to describe Sukhavati, as a place of unparalleled magnificence 
and splendour, in every way what Dharmakara had resolved it should be. 
Ananda expresses a desire to see Amitabha, whereupon that Buddha sends 
a ray of light from the palm of his hand, so that not only Ananda but 
every living being could see Amitabha and his retinue of bodhisattvas 
in Sukhavati." (EBu. 1.434-5)
The following conclusions emanate from the above:
1. There was a long tradition wherein Light rather than Enlightenment 
was important. The first of the 81 Tathagatas is Dipankara (dipa 
'lamp kara 'maker'). A ray of light from the palm of the Buddha 
reveals the resplendence of Sukhavati.
2. The Japanese Prof.,Akashi seeks the origin of Amitabha directly in 
the enlightenment of Sakyamuni... "After the Buddha's passing away, 
his enlightenment, consummated through wisdom and mercy, was expressed 
by and embodied in Amita" (EBu. 1.446). It is a perspicacious 
observation.
3. Dharmakara may be an actual monk of this tradition who systemati sed 
and wrote down the cult and doctrine of Amitabha.
4. Sukhavati is in the West. It magnificence recalls the Northwestem 
kingdoms of Bactria and neighbouring regions where the cults of Mithra, 
Euridika, Zoroastrianism mingled with Saiva and Buddhist traditions.

58
The Smaller Sukhāvativyuha is addressed by Sakyamuni to Sari putra 
at Jetavana in Sravast. It is a description of Sukhāvati, the 
Buddha-kṣetra of Amitabha. G.P. Malalase kera (EBu. 1.435) says that 
the description of Sukhavati is reminiscent of the Mahasudass ana-sutta 
of the DI gha-ni kaya. This sutta describes the metropolis of a 
universal monarch as surrounded by seven enclosures made of gold, 
silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, coral and one of all jewels. It recalls 
Ecbatana with its seven ramparts of diverse colours: gold, silver, 
orange, blue, purple, black and white (Herodotus 1.98, Przyluski 
1935: 25-). The universal monarch was like the sovereign of the gods. The celestial city of Amitabha was patterned after the ideal metropolis 
known to the East Irani an monks of Uttarapatha.
DI pankara the first in the line of Amitabha, symbolised lamp-light 
as well as belonged to northwestern India. Nagarahara (old capital 
of the Jalalabad district) is called the city of DIpan kara by Hui-li (Beal 1884:1.91 n. 36). A stupa was built by king Asoka at the spot 
in Nagarahara where Sakya had met Dipankara (Be al 1884: 1.92, 93). 
This is proved by the popularity of Dipankara at Shotorak and its 
transmission to China from N W India.
Amitabha's Pure Land is designated as Hsü-mo-t'i, Hsü-ho-mo-t'i 
in Chinese transcriptions_corresponding to Sanskrit Sukhavati/Sukhāmati 
or Suhamati/Sudhamati. It is translated into Chinese as An-lo and Chi-lo. It is interesting to note that the character An in
An-10安樂 is also used to designate Parthia. It was the Parthian 
prince An Shih-kao who translated the larger Sukhavati vyuha during 
A.D.148-170 from Sanskrit into Chinese, and introduced the Amitabha 
cult into China. This translation is lost (Nj.23/5 n. 1/II). The 
Amitabha cult must have been dominant in NW India and Eastern Iran 
(Parthia) at that time. Sukhavati is described as a vast land, the 
soil being composed of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, coral, red pearls 
and agate. There are audience halls, residential palaces, mansions 
and towers also decorated with seven kinds of gems (EBu. 1.451). 
These seven gems remind of the seven colours of the metropolis' in 
Iranian history.
The udicya or north-western regions of India, the Uttarapatha of 
the texts, had been saturated with Greek ideas and monks of East 
Iranian extraction whose Weltanschauung was formed by the glories of 
Ecbatana with its ramparts of seven colours, by reminiscences of the 
fabulous palaces of the Achaemeni ans, and by Mithra the Sun all 
these were reflected in Amitabha. At the same time it was a rejection 
of the ascetic simplicity of Sakyamuni's monks by Dharmakara who had 
given up his kingdom to bring into existence Amitabha in his paradise 
of Sukhavati resplendent with all its ponds, trees, palaces, music, sensual and sensitive pleasures. We can discern these historic 
elements in the legendary exuberance of the major Amitabha texts of 
the Larger and Smaller Sukhavativyuha and the Amitayur-dhyana-sutra. 
Vasubandhu wrote his Sukhavati-vyuhopadeśa (T 1524) on the 
Larger Sukhavatīvуüha. Vasubandhu hailed from Purus apura (Peshawar) 
and it was but natural for him to comment on the most prevalent text 
in his home region. 
Amitabha is flanked by Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprāpta. It 
seems that the development of triads (Japanese sanzon) was influenced 
by the traditions of Mithra who was flanked by his companions Rašnu (the god of Justice) and Sraoša (the god Obedience).

59
The cult of Bhaiṣajyaguru is another point of Buddhist contact 
with the Irani an *bo zak. Bhaiṣajyaguru is the Buddha of Healing. He
cures physical illness and dispels spiritual darkness. His sutra was 
translated into Chinese five times. The earliest translation by 
Srimitra dates to A.D. 317-322. In his paradise dwell innumerable 
bodhisattvas chief among whom are Surya-vai rocana and Candra-vairo cana. 
They are also known as Suryaprabha and Candraprabha. Bhai sajyaguru 
has Twelve Great Yaksa Generals (dvadasa mahāyaks a-senapatayah). 
Bhaişajyaguru developed in an age when an Irani an term like besaz 
'healing' was correctly understood as bhai sajya 'medicine, healing'. 
The two bodhisattvas Suryaprabha and Candraprabha are the counterparts 
of the Irani an Rašnu and Sraoša, companions of Mithra.
European scholars assert that Amitabha originated in an Iranian 
area, or under the influence of the solar myth of the Persians (L.A. 
Waddell), or Mithra (S.Beal), and its possible reference to the Avesta 
is upheld by P. Pelliot and Sylvain Lévi (EBu. 1.443). Bunzaburo 
Matsumoto cannects Amitabha with king Mahasudarsana or the Sun. Unrai
Ogiwara considers Visņu, another name for the Sun, as the origin of 
Amitabha.
As early as 1877 T.W. Rhys Davids had called attention to "the 
name 'Immeasurable light' given to Amitabha--from whom Gautama is said 
to have emanated: it points distinctly to contact with the old Persian 
light worship... We have thus Iranian influence distinctly before us, 
which accords with the local surroundings of the Gandhara school." 
(Grünwedel 1901:195, 1900: 114).
Waddell (1894: 127) reiterated the Iranian characteristics: "One
of the earliest of these celestial Buddhas was given the title of 
'The Infinite Light' (Amitabha), and his personality soon crystallized 
into a concrete theistic Buddha of that name, residing in a glorious 
paradise (Sukhāvati) in the West, where the daily suns hasten and 
disappear in all their glory, and hence supposed by some to include 
a sun myth or to be related to sun-worship, probably due to Persian 
influence; for the chief patrons of the early Mahayana, about the time 
of the invention of this myth, were Indo-Scyths, a race of sun- 
worshippers.
The Irani an elements have been highlighted by Eliot (1921: 3,220): 
The essential features of Amidist doctrine are that there is a paradi se 
of light belonging to a benevolent deity and that the good who invoke 
his name will be led thither. Both features are found in Zoroastri an 
writings. The highest heaven (following after the paradises of good 
thoughts, good words and good deeds) is called Boundless Light or 
Endless Light. Both this region and its master, Ahuramazda, are 
habitually spoken of in terms implying radiance and glory. Also it 
is a land of song, just as Amitabha's paradise re-echoes with music 
and pleasant sounds. ..
"Thus all the chief features of Amitabha's paradise are Persian: 
only his method of instituting it by making a vow is Buddhist. It is 
true that Indian imagination had conceived numerous paradises, and 
that the early Buddhist legend tells of the Tushita heaven. But 
Sukhavati is not like these abodes of bliss. It appears suddenly in 
the history of Buddhism as something exotic, grafted adroitly on the 
parent trunk but sometimes overgrowing it". Inote: "Is it possible 
that there is any connection between Sukhavati and the land of 
Saukavastan, governed by an immortal ruler and located by the Bundehish

60
between Turkistan and Chinistan? I imagine there is no etymological 
relationship, but if Saukavastan was well known as a land of the 
blessed it may have influenced the choice of a significant Sanskrit 
word with a similar sound".]
"Paul Pelliot admits that early Buddhism in India was subjected 
to Irani an influences. Sir Charles Eliot calls our attention to the 
fact that in the Avesta, where four paradises are described, the 
highest is called the 'Land of Endless Light', and that all the chief 
features of the Western Paradise of Amitabha of Infinite Light are to 
be found in Zoroastrian writings". (Getty 1928: 38).
VAIRO CANA
In the emergence of Vairocana, the family descent of the Buddha 
also seems to have played a significant role. The Buddha was a scion 
of Ikṣvāku lineage which was the Solar Dynasty par excellence. He was
the Son of the Sun family. Thus the transition from Sakyamuni to 
Vairocana was inherent in the line age of the Enlightened One. Virocana
means the 'sun'. The Sino-Japanese translation of Vairocana is 
Dai-nichi 'Great Sun'. Vairocana is also Cakravartin, the universal 
monarch. As such he is Ekakṣara Unisa- Cakravartin. He has two forms 
in the Japanese tradition: Shaka-kinrin (Shaka Sakyamuni, kinrin= 
cakravartin) and Dainichi-Kinrin (Huntington 1975:150).
The sun symbolises light. In the Upanisads themselves, light 
was knowledge: tamaso ma jyotir gamaya. The very word deva, Latin 
divus, English divine, are cognate to the root div 'to shine. ..'.
In the Saiva tradition, the Siva-lingas are Jyotirlingas. The
Enlightenment of the Buddha or the Enlightened Buddha was apotheosised 
as Dipankara, then as Amitabha, later on as Vairocana of the Avatamsaka 
and of the Garbhadhātu, culminating in Vairocana of the Vajradhātu. 
Amitabha and Vairocana of the Avatams aka and Garbhadhatu all have the 
same dhyana-mudra of meditation which marks them out as apotheoses of 
dhyana or Enlightenment. The sutras pertaining to Amitabha and the 
three manifestations of Vairocana belong to the same line of develop- 
ment of the Vaipulya tradition as shown already.
The Visnu-sahasra-nama represents the most popular Indian text 
of the genre of sahasra-nama texts of a thousand epithets of a divinity. The Thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa (included in the Vajradhatu 
mandala) also pertain to this category of literature. Among the 
thousand names several pertain to illumination, the luminosity of 
Enlightenment, to Buddha as the Light of the World or Jagad-vi rocana 
in, the words of the, Avatamsaka sūtra Gandavyuha. Instances are: 3 Kasyapa (from the kas to shine'), 7 Pradyota, 18 Mahaprabha, 19 
Arcişkandha, 20 Vairocana, 22 Candra, 23 Arcismant, 24 Suprabha, 
27 Pradyota, et passim (Weller 1928).
The Lalitavistara (Lefmann 383 lines 9,11) refers to Vairocana 
as the spokesman of the nilakayika devaputras. Edgerton 310 b 
interprets Nilakayika as the name of a class of gods noted only in 
this passage: Further on he explains the term: "Tibetan renders snon-po (blue) ris (form, figure, also party, like BHS kaya. This
suggests that Tib. understood 'belonging to the group of Nila (blue) one's, rather than blue-bodied. 
In LV they, and their spokesman

61
Vai ro cana, seem to be superior to the four mahārāja gods". The
nilakayika devaputras gave four stone vessels (sailapatra, L V 383.9) 
to the Four Maharajas of the four directions who offered them to Lord 
Buddha. This context occurs in the Trapusa-Bhallika chapter. Trapusa-
Bhallika belonged to the North-Westem region of Bhallika/Bahlika/ 
Balkh (Lokesh Chandra 1979). So Vairocana the Nilakayika king 
(Vairocano nama Nilakayiko devaputrah, L V. 383.11) should also belong 
to this region. Devaputra can signify a king. In fact, Vairocana is 
the name of a cakravartin, a former incamation of Maitreya, in the 
Mahavastu 1.59.2, 13. Further, vai rocana (virocana) is a jewel in 
the Mahavastu 2.317.13, Gandavyuha 101.12, 159.1 (Edgerton 1953: 512a). 
In this sense the word vai rocana reminds us of the Iranian term for 
turquoise: pērōz*. The word turquoise itself is the French feminine 
of turquois Turkish' pointing to its import from West Asia. The 
turquoise is an opaque sky-blue precious stone. NIlakaya can refer to 
an area abounding in blue (nila) stones like turquoise. Kayesa is 
a synonym for Vairocana, whom he replaces in the enumeration of the 
Five Buddhas in Sadhanamala 164.9. The expression Nilakayi ka 
devaputra is paralleled by tusitakavi ko devaputro (Mahavastu and 
Lalitavistara), tusitabhavanakayi ko devaputro in Mahavastu 1.174.1.
-kaya in Nilakayi ka can represent the Iranian kai (Avesta kavi) 
which was the title of local kinglets (Olmstead 1943:46). Then it 
would mean 'the kings (kaya) of the region of turquoise (nila)'. 
"A later dynasty, that of the Kayani ans--perhaps a Bactrian dynasty- 
derived their name and descent from Kai Kobadh (Av. Kavi Kavāta), 
followed by Kai Kaus (Av. Kavi Usa), Siyavash (Av. Syavarshan), Kai 
Khosru (Av. Husrava), Lohrasp (Av. Aurvat-aspa), and finally, Ghushtasp 
(Av. Vishtaspa)" (Casartelli 1914: 7.722a). Vishtaspa's first son was 
born in 550 B.C. To glorify the religion, the son was named Daraya- 
vohu-manah "The Upholder of a Good Mind" (Dharaya-vasu-manah in 
Sanskrit), Darayavaush in Western Persian and Darius to the Greeks.
*Prof. R.E. Emmerick of the Hamburg University has kindly sent me 
the following note: "firoz is an arabicised form of pērōz. It is 
difficult to say exactly when the spelling with f is first attested 
as it is often found as a variant in some MSS when others have p. 
The earliest occurrence of the word is Ammianus Marcellinus XIX 2.11 
(4th century AD) but it is attested as a personal name already in the 
Great Inscription of Sabuhr I (third century AD). P.Hom, Grundriss 
der neupersischen Etymologie, p.78 derived peroz from 'aw. *paiti. 
raočah-', which if correct would mean it is related to Sanskrit 
virocana, but already H.Hübschmann, Persische Studien, Strassburg 
1895, p.45 pointed out that this etymology is excluded by the Pahlavi 
spelling. The correct etymology of peroz was first given by W.B. 
Henning in Zeitschrift für Indologie und Iranistik, 1933, p.228. 
According to him it goes back to an Old Iranian form pari-aujah- 
and is thus related to Sanskrit ojas- 'power'. As far as I know 
this etymology has not been questioned by any serious scholar. Any 
etymology has to account for both Middle Persian pyrwz (peroz) and 
Middle Parthian prywj (paryo). The arabicised spellings with f 
date of course, only from the period after the introduction of the 
Arabic script"

62
Iranian royalty was endowed with khvareno, an effulgence or bright 
glory that attached to kings. "Under the Old Persian form farmah the 
word occurs in several well-known proper names, and even in Media, 
more than a century before Cyrus. The prophet Zarathustra was also 
endowed with this quasi-divine splendour" (ibid: 722a). The kings
of the Kayani an dynasty* are frequently referred to in the Yasht 
and Kai Khusro is hailed as a great hero (Yasht 5.49, 9.21, 15.32, 
17.41, 19.74). The likely Bactrian origin of the Kayanian dynasty 
accords with the Bactrian (Bhallika) association of the Nilakayi ka 
devaputra Vairocana. The hvareno farnah or the spiritual substance 
of the kingship of Iran was retained by the most renowned royalty of 
Iran, the Kavis, during several generations (ERE.1.206a). It was thus 
deeply rooted in the minds of Bactrian bhiksus and through them it 
was reflected as the effulgence (rocana) of Vairocana. The consort 
of Vairocana is in fact Rocana (wrongly Locana).
"The provenance of service able stones (i.e. turquoise) is limited 
to a few places whose history may be traced back for thousands of 
years.... It can hardly be doubted that the turquoise was obtained 
in the Sasanid period and even earlier in the mines around Nishapur... 
General Sir A. Houtum-Schindler has given a detailed account of
the Persian turquoise mines at Mash-had in Khurasan. (J. Ruska 
M. Plessner, article on firuzadi, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, new 
edition, Leiden 1965, 2.927-8). Material of excellent colour later 
was mined in Persia and brought into Europe through Turkey; this 
probably accounts for the mineral name. Iran has yielded material 
of finest quality, principally from the Ali-Mirs ai-Kuh mountains near 
Nishapur, in the province of Khurasan". (EB.1965: 22. 629).
Turquoise was in demand all over the ancient world from the 
Iranian are as. The king whose dominions were enriched by turquoise 
mining and export must have outshone his neighbours in opulence. His 
kingdom would have been a centre of prodigious wealth and international 
significance, whose prosperity and splendour must have kept pace. 
These rulers of turquoise, these nilakayikas, became embodiments of 
shine and shimmer, radi ance and brilliance, the virtual sons of 
luminescence (virocana), aptly named Vairocana. Moreover, this was 
in consonance with the most ancient traditions of Iran about royalty. 
From the times of Zoroaster, yasht 19 sings the praises of kingly 
glory, kavaya hvarenah, a sort of halo or radiance said to have been 
Possessed by kings and heroes of Iran in olden times (ERE.2.267).
Firuz, the Sasanian king of Iran from A.D. 457 or 459 to 484 was 
confronted in Bactria by the Hephthalites. He charged his cavalry 
into a hidden ditch and perished with all his troops (about 1 Jan 484).

University of Chicago Press).

63
(EB.1965: 9.316). It shows that Firuz, the word for turquoise, was 
the name of kings as late as the fifth century and that Bactria was 
within the orbit of Iranian history. No wonder that that Vairocana 
refers inter alia to turquoise, and enshrines the epic glories of 
Iranian kings through Buddhist monks of Iranian origin.
The configuration of the Vairocana mandala of Vajradhatu is 
described by the Nişpanna-yogavali 1949: 44 as follows: Vajradhatu- 
mandale vajra-pañjar-odare dvip-opadvipa-sapta-samudradi-pari kalita 
sumer-upari kuṭāgāram/tasya madhye simhopari... bhagavan Vairocano.... 
It means that in the Vajradhātu mandala Lord Vairocana is seated on 
a lion which is in the middle of a pavilion atop the Sumeru sorrounded 
by the seven seas, continents and sub-continents in vajra-precincts. 
The architectonic complex of the Vajradhātu mandala has a sanctified 
are a set off by vajras. Amidst the seven seas and continents arises 
mount Sumeru over which is the pavilion with the image of Vairocana 
mounted on a lion.
The full details of the construction of the mandala are provided 
by Mkhas-grub-rje (A.D.1385-1438) in the generation of the Residence 
(*adhar-otpatti). 
It is quoted below in extenso from Lessing/Wayman 
(1968:175): "he must imagine an earth surface (*bhumitala) made of 
many jewels and strewn with gold sand. He blesses it with the formula, 
Om cala, 
Upon it he imagines an ocean of milk, free from such a fault as 
fish-gills, adorned with such flowers as the red lotus (padma) and 
the blue lotus (utpala), and over which soar flocks of bejewelled 
birds. He blesses it with the formula, Om vimala daha hum.
In the middle of this ocean, he imagines a foursided Sumeru 
mountain, adorned on all four sides with rows of stairs made
respectively of gold, silver, sapphire (indranila), and amber, all 
over which spring up wish-granting trees (kalpa-vrksa) decorated with 
a thousand fluttering victory banners. He imagines rising above those 
to a height of many yojanas a lotus trunk which takes its origin from 
a shaft in the center of Mount Sume ru, is graced with many jewels, 
has leaves made of variegated jewels and blossoms whose filaments 
are of gold, anthers of amber, and tops of pistils ringed by lines of 
silver.
"Above it, he is to imagine a canopy (vitana) Cappearing in an 
instant. On top of that canopy, he generates the complete 
characteristics of an eaved palace (kutāgāra) and generates within it 
various seats; and he may also generate within the palace stūpas of 
the varieties victorious' and radi ant'." There after the gods are 
invited to be residents (adheya) and seats are offered to them in the 
kūtāgāra. Prof. Wayman (1973: 104, pl. 9, 102-109) has illustrated 
the Sumeru from a Tibetan painted scroll.
The three-storied pavilion which rests on the cloud atop Sumeru 
is Indra's palace called Sudarsana (Lessing 1942:104). "The tiny 
structure on the top of the palace roof may very well be a sty: ised 
part of a stupa. It will be recalled that Mkhas grub rje mentions 
two kinds of stupas that can be generated in the palace. Like the
standard stupa, this structure-- as the photograph is seen with a 
microscope-- also has on its very top the crescent moon surmounted 
by the sun, in turn surmounted by a hook-like curve that should 
represent fire". (Wayman 1973:109). Prof. Wayman's crescent moon

64
should be corrected to candra, the sun is the bindu and "the hook-like 
curve that should represent fire" is the nada. The se three are the 
candra, bindu and nada of pranava (1.e. OM).
The basic structure of the Borobudur is identical with the mandala: 
Borobudur 
mandala
5 terraces
=five storeys of the Sumeru 
3 circular platforms =base of kūṭāgāra 
1 large central finial1stupa
The horizontal incisions in the pinnacle must have held the wooden 
kuṭāgāra (see details in Lokesh Chandra 1980: 22).
The kuṭāgāra atop Sumeru represents Sudarsana the palace of Indra 
the king of gods and the colours of the rows of stairs are gold, silver, 
sapphire and amber.
As already pointed out another name of Vairocana is Ekākṣara 
Cakravartin.. As a çakravartin, a universal monarch, his residence is 
equated with Sudarsana, the palace of Indra. 
The city of a cakravartin 
has enclosures of gold, silver and other jewels. In the Dighani kaya 
2.170 the city of Kusavati was surrounded by seven enclosures made of 
gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, coral and one of all jewels. In 
the Mulas arvasti vada Vinaya Kusavati has seven enclosures, but made of 
four precious stones only: gold, silver, beryl and crystal. Di pavati, 
the capital of the Cakravartin Arcismat, has seven vedi kajal as of 
seven colours of gold, silver, mother-of-pearl, beryl, crystal, coral 
and ruby (Mahavastu 1.194.3, 19). Likewise the Sumeru of Vairocana 
has terraces of various jewels.
The city of a cakravartin recalls the royal city of the Medes 
Ecbatana (ancient Hagamatana, modern Hamadan) whose seven enclosures 
were of gold, silver, orange, blue, purple, black and white (Herodotus, 
5th century B.C., 1.98): Witness the city of Ecbatana with its seven 
surrounding walls of different colors, probably meant to correspond 
to the seven planetary spheres; their diminishing height from the 
center to the periphery presents an obvious parallel to the great 
towers of Babylonia and Assyria. Apparently within the innermost 
circle, which was of gold and corresponded to that of the sun, was the 
dwelling of the king, who, seated at the center of his cosmos, 
identified himself in that manner with the divinity. The Parthi an 
Darab gerd and the Sassani an fortress of Firuzabad are examples of cities 
with circular plans that were probably inspired by analogous symbolisms". 
(R. Gnoli, EWA. 3.839).
"The seven walls rising up one within another--recalling the seven 
tiers of the cosmic temple towers of Babylonia and Assyria--obviously 
are an image of the seven cosmic spheres, in the middle of which the 
Sun-King is seated; the golden wall around the royal palace reflects 
the brilliance of the sun, the silver wall next to it apparently that 
of the moon. The cosmic significance of this kingly city is cle ar 
"The residence of the Indian Cakravartin like that of the 
Babylonian monarch, is made after the model of the terraced towers 
surmounted by a temple. The universal monarch resides there because 
being like the sovereign of the gods, he must live like him at the 
summit of the cosmic mountain. Sumeru and the Zikkurat, the imperial 
city and the celestial temple, might be juxtaposed as equivalent 
symbols in the political and the religious order." (Przyluski 1935: 26). 
This is reflected in that Vairocana the cakravartin resides on the 
Sumeru in an eaved palace which is topped by a stupa..

65
According to Herodotus (1.96 ff.) the Medes were united into a 
strong and independent confederation by Deioces at the beginning of the 
seventh century B.C. Deioces, the village judge, was chosen king by 
the Medes after they won their independence from Assyria. Deioces 
built Ecbatana as the capital and ruled for 53 long years (about 727- 
675 B.C., EB.1965: 7.181). As the first historic capital of Iran, it 
became a national symbol as well as the glory of the Irani an people 
which touched their ethos to its very depths. It resounded into the 
farthermost eastern confines of the Iranian world, as far as Bactria 
and adjacent lands of Gandhara. When the people of these are as became 
ardent Buddhist devotees they expressed their new piety in terms of 
their deepmost symbols, one of which was the cosmocratic configuration 
of Ecbatana, which later became the inspiration and design of the 
mandala.
"...In the Parthian Darabjird the wall and fosse form an exact 
circle with an inner wall marking a concentric circle; the whole are a 
was divided into 8 equal sectors by radial axis streets ending in wall 
gates, 4 of which were situated at the 4 main points of the compass. 
Firuzabad in the very heart of Persis, originally the fortified 
residence of the new Sassani an dynasty, before its transference to 
Ctesiphon, is of the same circular type. In the 12th century Ibn al 
Balkhi says of it: "The city is like a circle traced with a compass". 
There was a gate at each of the main points of the compass and, 
undoubtedly, an axial street-cross connecting them.Istakhri writes 
of it in the 10th century: "It has four gates: in the east Bab Mihr, 
in the west Bab Bahram, in the north Bab Hormi zd, and in the south 
Bab Ardeshir". Residential cities such as Darabjird and Firuzabad 
must have been the prototype of the most famous of all the cosmic 
"round cities" of the East: Baghdad, "al-Madina al Mudauwara" The
Round City" of Mansur founded 762, at a moment chosen by Naubakht, 
the official astrologer of the caliph". (L'O range 1953:10).
"Vairocana, dwelling in the Akani stha Heaven, does not proceed 
elsewhere because he is the Sambhoga-kaya possessing the five 
certainties. But with the magical apparition (nirmita) of a Val rocana 
Nirmaṇa-kaya having four heads, he proceeded to the summit of Mt. 
Sumeru and took his place in the eaved palace (kūtāgāra) of precious 
thunderbolts. There he took his place on a lion's throne (simhasana) 
formed of the Bodhisattvas in their last life who had been transformed 
into the appearance of lions". (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 215).
Sumeru the abode of gods was a reflection of the apperception 
that the palatiue of a great king should be an image of the universe. 
In this connection the remarks of L'Orange are relevant:
"A certain ambiguity in our literary tradition at times placing 
Khusrau's heavens in the throne room, at another time in a fire temple, 
must be due to affinities existing between the sanctuary of the god 
of heaven and that of his representation and reflection on earth. As 
proved by archaeological evidence, a dominating type of fire temples 
and throne-rooms was a square domed building; and the dome must have 
had the same heavenly function in temple and palace." (L'Orange 1953: 23). 
"This is expressed by the Persian prince Tiridates to Nero when 
the latter crowns him King of Armenia (in Rome in the year 66 A.D.)

66
the conception of the Oriental King is transferred to the Roman 
emperor. On doing obeisance to Nero, Tiridates greets him as Mithra, 
the royal god of the Irani ans, declaring: "I shall be whetever you 
spin for me, for you are both my Moira and my Tyche ".
"It is therefore natural that the throne-room of the Great King 
should be an image of the universe and of the universal dominion of 
the stars. This is effected by introducing the cosmic movements, 
whether of the hall or of the throne, into the royal ritual". (L'Orange 
1953: 23)
"Hellenism had developed the astrology of the East into a 
scientific, religious-philosophic system which in Roman times had 
conquered the classical world. Even the empire was permeated with 
these Eastern ideas. The royal cosmocrator makes his entry into the 
Palatine. As a striking expression of this theology the revolving 
rotunda now invades the imperial palace. Suetonius describes a 
similar rotunda in the Domus Aurea built by Nero in the last years of 
his reign (started in the year 64 A.D.) hardly a generation before 
Suetonius' account". (L'O range 1953: 28)
The king is the Sun-Cosmocrator, spinning the fate of mortals. 
Vairocana me ans 'the sun', and he is the Cakravartin = Cosmocrator. 
The second element vartin in cakravartin reflect the cosmic movement. 
Let us go back to Iran and Iranian concepts in Rome:
"At the same time at which this cosmic hall was built, Nero in a 
number of official images is represented as Apollo-Helios, or he acts 
in persona, in the theatre and circus, as this god. In the astrological 
conception this Nero-Helios is cosmocrator like the kings of the East. 
Thus, as we have just seen, the Persian prince Tiridates did obeisance 
to him as the royal God of Fate (66 A.D.). In the very guise of Sun- 
Cosmocrator Nero appears to us in the huge statue in the vestibule of 
the Golden House. And here the image of Nero is especially expressive: 
for this Nero-Cosmocrator is in itself the moving principle in the 
revolving rotunda of the palace. He is, as Cicero says of the Sun, 
"Leader, prince and controller of the heavenly lights, the soul of the 
world and its directive force" (dux et princeps et moderator luminum 
reliquorum, mens mundi et temperatio). From his more elevated sphere 
the Emperor God sets the lower spheres in motion, and directs the whole 
of the sub-lunary world, thus affecting, according to the astrological 
doctrine, the life of man and spinning like the Great King of the East 
at the New Year's festival, the fate of mortals. The emperor is the 
cosmic God of Fate: Moira, Tyche, as Tiri dates names Nero, fatorum 
arbiter, as an emperor is called in an inscription. (L'Orange 1953: 29-30) 
"We witness a solemn act by which the Great King adjusts himself 
to the movements of the heavens, thus manifesting his own astral power. 
Just as. Sun, Moon and planets in completing their orbits determine the 
fate of the universe, so the movements of the royal throne reveal the 
fatal power of the Great King; he is analogous to the heavenly bodies, 
the Cosmocrator. ... Let us remember once more the functions of the 
king at the New Year festival (Nauroz = New Day), when he allots state 
offices just as the Sun God distributes the various spheres of influence 
for the coming cosmic year. He is part of the all moving orbit of the 
stars, "Companion of the Stars, brother of the Sun and Moon", and 
already from ancient times wears Sun and Moon in his tiara".

67
"A cosmic throne-movement of this kind belongs in fact to the 
festival ritual of the Persian Nauröz celebrations. Palace reliefs 
in Persepolis, for instance in the "Hall of the Hundred Columns" and 
in the "Central Building", illustrate this ceremony with the bringing 
of tribute from all parts of the kingdom". (L'Orange 1953: 85).
Vairocana in his Sarvavid form and as the Ekakṣara Cakravartin 
holds a wheel like Mithra who seizes the zodiacal wheel: "Let us 
look a little more closely at this idea of the emperor as cosmic God 
of fate. The God... the volvens sidera Mithra seizes the zodiacal 
wheel and hurls it into revolving motion, thus setting the whole system 
of the spheres in motion. To the Roman world Mithra in his cave has 
the same significance: the cave is the world bounded by the firmament 
of fixed stars. The god fills this world cavity just as the emperor 
his cosmic hall. Like Mithra also the Roman emperor takes the zodi ac 
in his hand" (L'Orange 1953: 33). The wheel had a cosmocratic 
significance: "The Ancient World conceived the às pís, the clipeus 
that is the circular shield with a border around the middle disk 
as an image of the revolving All, the cosmos. From Aischylos (Sept. 
498) and down to late literature this shield is compared with the 
rotating wheel, the ever apt symbol of the Universe". (L'Orange 1953: 90) 
"...the Persian-Arabian tradition has preserved the memory of 
Tabari tells such revolving motions in the palace of the Great King. 
of an architect in the Sassani an service who said himself able to 
build palaces revolving with the Sun. "Had I known for sure that you 
would give me my full wages and treat me as I deserved", he says to 
Yazde gerd (reigned 399-420, EB. 1965: 17.574), "I would have 
constructed a building revolving exactly with the Sun." (L'O range 
1953: 21)
The throne of Vairocana is held aloft on four bodhisattvas 
transformed into four lions. This has a parallel in the Iranian world: 
In the Sassani an legends about the Nauroz feast, reported by Albiruni, 
the bearing of the enthroned king plays a role strikingly confirming 
our cosmic interpretation of the Achaemeni an throne picture. The king 
is lifted on the necks of his supporters and becomes a new Sun. The 
mythic Persian king, Jamshid, we learn, sat on a golden throne and 
was thus carried away by the men on their necks. When then the rays 
of the sun fell on him and people saw him, they did homage to him 
and were full of joy and made that day a feast day" (the Nauroz). 
"He rose on that day like the sun, the light beaming forth from him, 
as though he shone like the sun. Now people were astonished at the 
rising of two suns". (L'Orange 1953: 87)
"A fundamental feature of the Ancient Eastern throne, as 
repeatedly stressed, is its being carried by zoa. Even in the 
Sumerian kingdom the royal throne stood on a platform supported by 
animals, and ... the succeeding centuries yield an infinity of 
examples of this practice. We only recall Jahve's Cherub- and the 
Sassanian horse-, griffin-, eagle- and lion-throne. The Achaemeni an 
gathu had four corner supports in the form of hybrid zoa.. The form 
crystallizes into a stereotype still existing in the East. As an 
example may be mentioned the Takht i marmar in the throne room in 
Teheran: the stand is supported by Lions and demonic creatures. In 
the more remote East, too, such throne-stands supported by attendant

68
beings belong to kings and gods." (L'Orange 1953:124)
The Sun and Moon in Tantric art, e.g. Suryaprabha and Candraprabha 
flanking Bhaiṣajyaguru, besides Amitaprabha (amita = sun) and 
Candraprabha in the samaya-mandala of Vairocana (Esot. 517, 520) remind. 
us of the Sun and Moon symbolism of the Achaemeni an royalty. "The 
symbolism is the same when... just as Septimius Severus was shown 
between the planetary deities- the emperors of late antiquity are 
represented between the Sun and the Moon, as is the case, for instance, 
on the Roman arch of Constantine. These sun-moon symbols, originally 
distinguishing the Eastern king, make the emperor appear a particeps 
si de rum, frater Solis et Lunae, as the Sassanian kings officially 
called themselves. Already in Achaemeni an times the Persian king was 
On seals and coins 
represented symbolically related to Sun and Moon. 
his bust is placed between Sun and Moon or constellations of these 
heavenly bodies, which also occur in his tiara in the he ad ornament 
of the royal horse.
"From the Roman emperor the sun-moon symbol was inherited by the 
medieval rulers of the West. Frederick II has a star and Moon in his 
seal, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, the Sun and Moon, the coronation mantle 
is frequently decorated with the Sun, Moon and stars, etc." (L'Orange 
1953: 36)
"As a hieroglyphical expression of this Logos cosmocrator, the 
authoritatively speaking hand--the hand of the dogma, of the verbum 
suum, of the Logos--is represented between Sun and Moon, the 
traditional symbols of the world dominion" (L'0 range 1953:197).
Thus we find that the glories of Irani an Geist and Raum find a 
deep expression in the Vairocana cult: the word Vairocana mirrors 
pi ruz turquoise' (virocana is a kind of stone), mandala is the cosmic 
round city, the seven ramparts of Iranian capitals with their colours 
have parallels in the terraces of the Sumeru ornamented with various 
jewels, Vairocana as the Ekakṣara Cakravartin has a precedent in the 
Cosmocrator and his cults in Iran, the wheel in the hand of Sarvavid 
Vairocana has a parallel in Mithra who hurls the zodi acal wheel into 
motion, the four lions of the throne of Vairocana repeat the zba of 
Irani an thrones, while Sun and Moon as symbols of world dominion are 
The bodhi of Gautama the 
common to Vairocana and Achaemenian kings. 
Buddha was transmuted into the abhi sambodhi of the Vairocana Tathagata.
HE RUKA
Heruka, also known as Cakra-saivara, is the central deity of the 
It means 'Oh (He) 
anuttara-yoga Tantras and sits on a solar seat. 
Light (ruka), as the highest epiphany in the Tantric systems. It can 
be compared to the word gartaruk in the Dawn Hymn of the Rgveda 1.124.7. 
It is one of the four similes that in their gradation illustrate the 
increasing beauty of Usas. Patil (1980: 22), following Geldner, derives 
the word from garta +/ruc, and the compound means 'that shines or 
looks splendid on the stage, i.e. a dancing girl'. Compare ruk-ma 
that is bright or radi ant', and its derivative rukmini the glowing 
beauty'.

69
An image of Heruka has been found in Indonesia from Bahal II, 
Padang Lawas 'Great Plain' in Central Sumatra (Kempers 1959: 77, p1.228). 
The Sumatran king Adityavarman was ordained as a manifestation of 
Bhairava. His enormous portrait-statue as Bhairava can be seen in the 
Jakarta Museum (Kempe rs 1959: 87, pl. 259). The portrait-statues of 
kings identifid with their highest deity were common in Indonesia. 
The statue of Siva at Lara-Jonggrang is a portrait-statue of its 
founder king. The Indonesian name Erucakra/He rucakra has not been 
explained in a satisfactory manner so far (for its different 
explanations see Santoso 197682). The term is attributed to King 
Jayabhaya of Kediri (East Java) who ruled around the 11th century. 
Till recently the leaders of political movements, were called
He rucakra. One of the titles of the Sultan of Yogyakarta is Herucakra. 
Mr. Angkasaputra of Bali, who worked with me on the poem Bharatayuddha, 
explained the term Herucakra as 'Divine Light, he who is the Light of 
the Land, that is: a king who rules all countries". This explanation 
was given to Mr. Angkasaputra by his teacher. He rucakra is a 
syncopation of Heruka Cakras amvara. The tendency of dis syllabism is 
so strong in Indonesian languages that Sams-krta became Krta (bhasa). 
This proclivity led to the shortening of Heruka to Heru and of 
It shows that Heruka was associated with Cakrasamvara to cakra. 
Light in Indonesia, as well as with the charisma of political power.

THE JAKA DOLOG INSCRIPTION OF KRTANAGARA
LOKESH CHANDRA
General Observations.
The Sanskrit inscription on the base of the Jaka Dolog statue at Simpang 
(Surabaya) has been discussed for nine decades since it was noticed by Verbeck 
in 1881. Eminent historians of Indonesia, like Brandes (1898), Kern (1910), 
Krom (1913, 1919), Bosch (1920), Poerbatjaraka (1922), Moens (1924), Berg 
(1959), have treated it at length. In a recent discussion, Nihom has tried to 
specify the type of Tantric Buddhism followed by King Krtanagara who is 
supposed to be an adherent of a 'Hevajra' cult, and to locate the original site of 
the Jaka Dolog statue at Candi Jawi. Nihom is right that there is "no evidence" 
for a Kalacakra cult in Indonesia.
Nomenclature of Tantras: Choice of nomenclature is crucial to an appro- 
priate understanding of the tantra followed by Krtanagara. In this connection, 
it is to be noted that Tantric Buddhism had several distinct manifestations. These 
bore specific characteristics and they were classified in India itself. Based on an 
Indian classification, the Tibetan tradition divides the Tantras into four divisions : 
kriyā, caryā, yoga and anuttara-yoga. Each division has a main deity :
kriya-tantrasAmitabha 
carya-tantras Vairocana 
Mahāvairocanayoga-tantras
anuttara-yoga tantras
(i) yogi-tantras (mahayoga-tantras in Atisa) Guhyasamāja, Vajrapāņi, etc. 
(ii) yogini-tantras (anuttara-yoga-tantras in Atisa) divided into seven 
groupings, of which the second group pertains to Heruka (i.e. Akṣobhya): 
(a) Samvara (Toh. 368-415) 
(b) Hevajra (Toh. 417-432) 
(c) Buddhakapāla (Toh. 424) 
(d) Mahāmāya (Toh. 425) 
(e) Arali (Toh. 426-427)
198
Navonmeşa

(iii) Neither yogi nor yogini-tantras
Nama-sangiti
Kalacakra
Two parallel lines of development emerge out of the above. The evolution 
of deities (a) based on Light, the rays radiating from the samadhi of Sakyamuni, 
and (b) the predominance of arcane elements, the esoteric (guhya of Guhya- 
samāja), the yogi and yogini groupings, culminating in a transcendence into 
Kalacakra and the non-aligned Nama-sangiti which cannot be assigned to any 
deity from the text itself and was hence associated with several deities. The. 
evolution of Light was from Amitabha ("Infinite Light"), to Rocana in the 
Avatamśakasutras, to Vairocana in the carya-tantras, to Ekakṣara Cakravartin 
in the ritual texts, and to Mahāvairocana in the yoga-tantras. Amitabha sits on 
a peacock and developed in the North-West of India, and hence the Peacock 
Throne in Iran till recent times. Rocana is the Daibutsu at Nara as a political 
symbol. Vairocana pertains to amala-vijñāna and Mahāvairocana to śāśvata- 
jñāna. They form the pair of Mandalas, the Twin Mandala of Japanese Mantra- 
yana (Shingon), and they are non-dual (advaya). The second part of the Sang 
Hyang Kamahāyānikan (SHK) refers to the Five Buddhas of the Vajradhātu 
mandala, beginning with Mahāvairocana. In fact the second part is Advaya- 
sadhana (colophon of ms. B on p. 70), pointing to the non-duality of the two 
Vairocanas.
The arcane tradition essentially centred around the Akşobhya of Guhya- 
samāja of the mahāyoga-tantras. In the anuttara-tantras, Samvara/Cakrasamvara 
and Hevajra/Heruka were the main deities. Hevajra and Heruka have been used 
synonymously in the Nispanna-yogavali (text p. 14: Hevajra in lines 3, 20 but 
Heruka in lines 13, 17, Heruka-catuṣṭaya on page 20 line 2 but Hevajra-catuṣṭaya 
on p. 21 line 16). This was the most esoteric system. It was anuttara and niruttara, 
unsurpassable. A precise nomenclature of tantra constellations helps to specify 
Nihom's (485) assumption that two tantric constellations of Akşobhya and 
Vairocana were practised by King Krtangara. The King did not follow the cycles 
of Samvara and Hevajra.
Jaka Dolog: name and function. The name Jaka Dolog has been translated 
as Doddy Fatty (Hall 1968: 73). Jaka in Javanese means 'hoofdperson: principal 
or central figure', and dolog means 'plump'. I am inclined to see in Jaka, the 
Sanskrit yakṣa, Pali yakkha, Prakrit jakkha. The yakṣas were nagara-devatās, 
city-deities and were represented as fatty statues. Jaka Dolog could have been 
the Deity of Unified Java, yakṣa of the Four Dvipas (Compare catur dvip-esvaro 
in verse 10 of the inscription). Kern (1910: 187) has interpreted it as an image 
of Mahākṣobhya and Poerbatjaraka (1922: 426) follows him. The inscription says 
that it was consecrated a second time by the King at Wurara cemetry, according to 
Lokesh Chandra

Mahākṣobhya (mahakṣobhy-anurupatdḥ) rise, at an auspicious moment, for the 
well-being of the people, of his family, because the country was united (kṣity- 
ekibhava-karaṇat). The second consecration was a thanks-giving that the country 
had remained united, a political feat achieved by the father of the King. It points 
to a fair likelihood that the image was conceived of as a nagara-devatā, a symbol 
of national unity, and jaka carries these reminiscences. What is the meaning of 
Mahakṣobhy-anurupataḥ? The word Mahākṣobhya is not attested anywhere in the 
Sanskrit, Tibetan or Japanese traditions. There are several forms of Akṣobhya : 
as the simplest form he is one of the Five Buddhas of the Vajradhātu two-armed 
and touches the earth (bhumisparśa mudra). In fact the Five Buddhas represent 
the five stages of Enlightenment :
Akṣobhya a firm unshakable resolve to achieve enlightenment
Ratnasambhavathe emergence (sambhava) of mind for potential light/illumina- 
tion symbolised by a jewel (ratna).
Amitabhathe infinite light is attained through samadhi, and hence in 
samadhi-mudra
Amoghasiddhi siddhi accomplished as the summum of tantras.
Mahavairocana the perfect (agri) Enlightenment (bodhi) represented by the 
bodhyagri mudrā.
Akṣobhya is imperturbable, unshakable, the abiding and lasting, the unfai- 
ling and unalterable, the enduring forever, the prime permanence. All this was 
related to the land, the Earth, in the earth-touching (bhumi-sparśa) mudra. It 
well correlates to the abiding unity of the land (bhumi), the nation. The Earth- 
Goddess emerges at the feet of Harihara who blesses the king and queen for the 
continuing stability of their dominions (Pal 1975: 66 pl. 9). It seems that the 
Jaka Dolog is an image of Akşobhya, conceived of as the permanent unity of the 
country, and Mahākṣobhya represents the esoteric system of the Guhyasamāja, 
which is a mahāyoga-tantra. The word maha was prefixed to more evolved forms 
of deities in the continuing processes of Buddhist theogony: e.g. Pratisarā became 
Mahapratisarā. The first verse of the inscription reads Tathāgatam. . .sarva- 
skandh-atiguhya-stham. The adjective atiguhya stands for Guhya-samaja, also 
termed Tathāgata-guhyaka. As an epithet of Tathāgata it defines the system. The 
earlier image of Akṣobhya was re-consecrated according to the esoteric rites of 
Mahakṣobhya (Mahākṣobhy-anurupataḥ), as Akṣobhya was a favourite deity of 
Krtanagara.
Several instances of statues dedicated to the stability of the state can be cited. 
In the classical Hindi-Buddhist world, an integral interdependence bound a sover- 
eign state and sanctifying scriptures. The state found revitalising syntheses in 
spiritual manifestations. Buddhist rites stabilised emperium in China and Japan.

As early as A.D. 402-409, Kumarajiva translated the Kārumikarāja-sutra, a sūtra
for the protection of the country by benevolent kings. Ceremonies of this sūtra 
were national events in Japan from the seventh century onwards (Visser 1935: 13). 
In A.D. 746 Emperor Shomu ordered it "to be expounded for the strength and 
maintenance of the dynasty, the rest of the State, and the welfare of the people" 
(Visser 1935:117). During the T'ang dyansty Buddhist sutras were used for "the 
benefit aud advantage of the state" (Ch'en 1964:218). The Vaisravana-kalpa (T 
1247) by Amoghavajra, adds in the colophon that during the 'grand troubles of the 
Five Kingdom', one tried in vain during eight months all sorts of other ceremonies. 
Only the rite prescribed in this text proved efficacious for stabilising the country.
In A. D. 587 Prince Shotoku built the Shitennoji Temple at Osaka in honour 
of the Four Lokapālas to overcome the rival Mononobe and Nakatome clans 
(Matsunaga 1969: 40 n. 102). In Japan, Ichiji Kinrin or Ekākṣara Cakravarti is 
a form of Vairocana who is identical with the Vairocana described in the Kawi 
text Sang Hyang Nagabayusutra (Bosch 1929: 131). The Japanese emperor Shomu 
issued a rescript in A. D. 743 ordering the construction of the gigantic statue 
(daibutsu) of Vairocana, 16 metres in height, at the Todaiji monastery in his 
attempt to unify the nation in an awareness of its power, as an "apt symbol of the 
emperor as the controlling head of the state" (Kobayashi 1975: 22), as "an espe- 
cially valuable political and religious symbol" (Kobayashi 1975: 25) to consoli- 
date the sovereignty of the nation in a harmony of the emperor and his people on 
the deeper spiritual levels of a shared awareness : it was a 'Grand National 
Temple'. When the old capital at Nara was abandoned and a new capital was 
established at Kyoto in A. D. 794, the Toji temple was an integral part of the 
metropolitan masterplan. It was "intended to invoke the protection of the divini- 
ties and thereby to assure the peace and prosperity" (Sawa 1972: 130) of the 
kingdom. It was placed in charge of Kobo daishi himself, the great master who 
introduced Mantiayana Buddhism with its central deity of Vairocana. The temple 
was significantly termed Kyo-o-gokoku-ji temple for the protection of the state', 
which popularly came to be known as the Toji (To=east, ji= temple) as it was 
built on the east side of the city gate.
Observations on the Inscription
In the second verse, the reading is anvatas sarvasiddhim va vande 'ham. The 
first word anvataḥ can be antataḥ in apodosis to adav in verse I. Firstly I pay 
homage to the Tathāgata who is an embodiment of jñāna and finally (antataḥ). 
I salute Sarvasiddhi, that is Amoghasiddhi. Amoghasiddhi is the final of the 
Five Buddhas in the 22nd chapter of the Amoghapāśa-sutra as well as in the 
Vajradhātu-mandala of the Tattva-sangraha. The final part of the Tattva-sangraha 
is devoted to all kinds of transcendent and worldly siddhis.

The name Jangala in verse 6 reminds of Kuru-jangala, north-west of Hastina-
pura. It was included in Kurukṣetra. Panjalu brings to mind Pancala, originally 
north and west of Delhi. South Pancala was the kingdom of King Drupada 
whose daughter Draupadi was married to the Pandavas. Verse 7 begins dina-yasmāt 
(Kern, but Krom reads kintu yasmat). If Kern's reading dina yasmat is accepted 
it would mean "from the day (dināt) "Visnuvardhana ruled the land, the country 
was united, and now his son could devote his energies to the promotion of dharma 
and for stabilising the gains of his father (verse 9), and whereas (yathaiva) he 
was engaged in the restoration of religious foundations, he reconsecrated the image 
at Wurara cemetry. It was not a transfer but a simple re-dedication according to 
more powerful esoteric rites.
Nihom (488) translates ajanma-parisuddhanga (verse 8) as "he who has a 
body diminished since birth", and continues to add: "This is certainly not the 
easiest reading". He arrives at this meaning on the basis of MW. who translates 
parisuddha "cleaned, purified, pure, cleared of, paid; acquitted, discharged, 
MBh.; Kav.; Pur.; (ifc) diminished by, that from which a part has been taken 
away, MBh". In Sanskrit the root sudh means "to pay, to clear (debts)". This 
has been taken from PW: sad-bhaga parisuddha "von dem das sechstel (für den 
Fürstan) abgezogen ist" MBh. 13.5550. It refers to the fact that the sixth part due 
to the state as tax has been deducted. It is a specific term of state revenue and does 
not apply to the body. The verse in the MBh. 13.113.16 (Pune ed.) reads:
sad-bhaga-parisuddham ca kṛṣer bhagam uparjitam
vaisyo dadad dvijatibhyaḥ papebhyaḥ parimucyatell
A vaiśya who donates to brāhmaṇas, from earned agricultural income after 
the due sixth part has been paid as state revenue, is absolved of sins. The income 
donated has to be pure to earn merit. Thus the word parisuddha can never mean 
that Visnuvardhana was "physically compromised". The virtuous qualities of King 
Visnuvardhana are lauded: he was of pious inclination since birth, kind, dedicated 
to dharma, and moreover a joy to kings by his might and prowess in uniting the 
Land that pleased the people; by ushering in an era of peace and prosperity. Just 
as father Visnuvardhana was innately pure and pious, so was his son Krtanagara 
by virtue of his knowledge: jñana-rasmi-vi suddhangaḥ. Krtanagara had under- 
gone consecrations and the luminosity of knowledge had made him devout and 
dedicated to dharma. The words parisuddhanga and viśuddhanga applied to father 
and son stress their fervent devotion, dedication and commitment to national 
unification and its stabilisation through cosmic powers of dharma. The word anga 
in both the places (verses 8, 12) does not mean 'a limb of the body', but refers to 
the components of dharma, and by double entendre refers to the five components 
of counsel (pancanga mantra): 1. karmaṇām ārambhopayaḥ means of commen- 
cing operations. 2. puruşa-dravya-sampad: providing men and materials, 3. desa- 
kala-vibhāga: distribution of place and time, 4. vipatti-pratikara : counteraction
202
Navonmeṣa

of disaster, 3. karya-siddhi: successful accomplishment. The word anga is arya-
aṣṭungika-marga is the eight-fold path pointed out by the Buddha. These eight 
divisions (anga) are the virtuous life. In the yoga-tantras, there are sixteen ways 
(angas) to evoke each deity (Lessing/Wayman 1968: 236-7). The yoga-tantra 
with Vairocana of the Vajradhātu was prevalent in Indonesia since the eighth 
century. The tenor of the inscription is religious and the fervour of both father 
and son is emphasised. The context of ajanma-parisuddhangu and jñāna-rasmi- 
visuddhanga is spiritual and not physical, even from the linguistic point of view. 
Both the expressions emphasise the purity and peity in every way (anga), in every 
respect. Yoga is ast-anga or sad-anga.
As the country had been unified, a nation-wide facelift and restoration of the 
religious establishments was undertaken to strengthen her integrity. As (yathaiva, 
verse 10) the restoration of the monuments (jirnoddhara-kriyä, verse II) was in 
enthusiastic swing (udyukta), the King re-consecrated with devotion the image 
that he had earlier consecrated in person (svayam) in the cemetry named Wurara. 
This re-consecration was done according to highly esoteric rites of Mahākṣobhya 
who is the Akṣobhya of the Guhyasamaja. The Guhyasamaja-Akṣobhya is the 
main deity of the mahāyoga-tantra group according to the classification of Atisa 
(Lessing/Wayman 1968:100). In the centre of his pentapartite crown, in the 
central leaf of the crown on the middle head, there is generally a wheel (Getty 
1928:144), a cakra of the cakravartin. King Krtanagara seems to have introduced 
advance esoteric empowerments and this occasioned the new consecration.
Nihom (485) has himself spoken of the "unfortunate choice of nomenclature 
which led to incorrect conclusions." The Tantras share common rituals and terms, 
like ganacakra, ganamandala, the trinity of kaya, vāk and citta, the two utpanna and 
sampanna kramana, śmaśāna, etc. These terms are a common heritage of the various 
classes of tantras. Variations in the same ritual or location are also possible: thus 
there are a number of eight śmaśāna and separate rites connected with them. Simple- 
looking terms like jñāna and vijñāna become highly specific and distinguish two 
Vairocanas in two mandalas: vijñāna relates to vairocana of the Garbha mandala 
and jñāna to Mahavairocana of the Vajradhātu maṇḍ ala. The term jirnoddhāra 
is linked by Nihom specifically to Saiva contexts. It is a general term and refers to 
repair and restoration in general. We have to be cautious in either simplification 
or specialisation. In the Jaka Dolog inscription it refers to restoration in general.
Krtanagara's initiation name is given in verse 12 as Jñana-śiva-vajra : Śiva 
refers to Saiva initiation and vajra to Vajrayanic/Tantric Buddhist empowerment. 
It is an un-ambiguous statement of the inter-denominational harmony practised by 
the king himself.

The name of the author of the inscription is Nadajña (verse 18) and not
Nada as given by Nihom throughout his paper (e.g. p. 486)
The reading of the second half of verse 19 according to Kern is: 
śaka-kala-sambaddha-Vajrajñānaśiva-— ||19||
Kern emends:
saka-kālas sambaddhe'yam Vajrajñānasiväśrayaḥ ||19||
Poerbatjaraka 1922: 429 reads:
śaka-kālam sambaddhatya tad-rājānujñayā punaḥ ||19||
The reading is uncertain, and no conclusions can be based on it.
Observations on Nihom's Paper
Nihom points to Candi Jajawa as the original site of Jaka Dolog. To put 
the situation in a proper perspective it is imperative to identify the image at Candi 
Jajawa, and a reconsideration of the Nagarakṛtāgama is essential. The Nagara- 
kṛtāgama is clear that Krtanagara installed a statue of Siva in Candi Jajawa 
and its crown had an image of Akṣobhya which was of high sanctity because of 
its supernatural powers (siddhi) and it verily merged (winaśa) into the supreme 
(parama) absolute (sunyatattva). The Candi Jajawa was a foundation (kirtti) of 
Krtanagara who had erected it himself in person (sarira) and this was the reason 
that both Saiva and Buddhists worshipped here in the past regularly. The trans- 
lation of these passages by Pigeaud and Nihom have to be corrected. Akşobhya in 
the crown is a small image as can be seen clearly in the Padang Roco Heruka, 
which I am inclined to interpret as a representation of Krtanagara (Kempers 1959: 
87 pl. 259, Nihom 485). King Visnuvardhana must have named his son Krtanagara 
as one who would usher in the golden age (kṛta-yuga) in the country (nagara). 
Krta-yuga or Satya-yuga is the first of the four ages of the world. King Visņu- 
vardhana was apotheosised in a Saiva statue at Waleri and a Buddhist statue at 
Jajaghu. Jajaghu had the 13 deity mandala of Amoghapāśa (Kempers 1959: 85). 
Bronze plaques of this mandala were made by King Krtanagara. It seems that 
while Visnuvardhana was apotheosised as Amoghapāśa, his son Krtanagara was 
devoted to Akşobhya. Continuing the liberal traditions of his father who was 
apotheosised both as a Saiva and a Buddhist deity, he enshrined a Siva at Candi 
Jajawa with an Akṣobhya in the crown. The image of Candi Jajawa is described 
in the Nagarakṛtāgama 56. 1-57.4. The translation of Pigeaud needs to be redone. 
We reproduce below the text and translation of Pigeaud, followed by a revised 
interpretation :

56.1.Now (as to) the arrangement of that eminent dharma (domain) 
there in olden times, so it is said, according to oral tradition :
it was a kirti (foundation) of the Illustrious Kertanagara, the Prabhu, the Prince's 
great-grandfather was He.
In fact, so it said, He erected it Himself, there was nobody else.
Therefore were double, Shiwaites and Buddhists, the honoured
ones who performed worship in the past, regularly.
56.2.The token is the candi (monument) is, below, a Shiwaite place, 
with a top, a Buddhist place, high up,
and inside is a Shiwa-likeness, splendid, its majesty unmeasured.
An Akṣobhya-pratima (statuette) was on high, a crown, not otherwise, small was 
that.
A consequence of His supernatural power was its disappearance,
verily the Non-entity's supreme (manifestation).
57.1. There were now, one hears, at the time that the honoured holy 
Akṣobhya-likeness vanished,
renowned, the Feet of the paduka (His Magnificence) the Illustrious 
Mahaguru (Grand Master) of Rajyadhika,
57.2. He now made a tour visiting holy places; with pleasure he sojourned in the 
eminent dharma (religious domain) in the Interior.
This now was causing irritation in the heart of the worshipful sthāpaka (abbot);
having his doubts,
Lokesh Chandra
205

57.3.The excellent muni (sage), He told the state of the honoured holy eminent
dharma (domain) in the past,
and His presence, of the honoured holy Akṣobhya-likeness, most subtle, high up.
56.1 It is clear that>Candi Jajawa was founded by Krtanagara, and he conse- 
crated it himself (rakwa sira), in person (sarira) and not through anyone else. 
The consecration rites were performed by the king personally and not through 
a priest. The word adhisthita is not 'erected' (Pigeaud), but 'consecrated'. That is 
the reason, that both (dvaya) Saiva priests and Buddhist monks performed worship 
constantly in the past. Pigeaud's 'double' is 'both', 'the honoured ones' is 'priests 
and monks'.
56.2 The translation of Pigeaud has missed both the sense and the spirit of 
the verse. It means: the distinctive speciality (cihna) of the Candi was its composite 
architecture; it was a Saiva monument in the lower part and was Buddhist on top. 
Besides the architectural exterior, the temple, was composite also within (mwan ri 
jro) the sanctum with a syncretic image of Siva with an Akşobhya in the crown. 
Krtanagara was a devotee of Śiva-Buddha, for we know that on passing away he 
attained the abode/paradise of Śiva-Buddha (bhaṭāra śri Krtanagara, sira san lina 
ri Sivabuddhalaya, INI 38f (2a.5) 1296). The image of Siva was splendid, its 
serenity beyond measure. Atop in its crown (makuța) was an image of Akṣobhya, 
without compare (?). Pigeaud's rendering "not otherwise, small was that" ill-fits 
the context. In his notes, Pigeaud amplifies "narrow, small, with the connotations: 
trifling, hidden". The image of Akşobhya in the crown of Siva must have been 
small as compared to the main image as well as hidden to enhance its esoteric 
effects. The intention of the poet is to bring on par both the Saiva and Buddhist 
elements. So tan hanolyantika should correspond in meaning to halép niraparimita. 
The newly discovered manuscripts have to be consulted to shed light on this phrase. 
Pigeaud's translation of the fourth quarter is misleading. The statuette of 
Aksobhya though relatively small in size and hidden, but because of its supernaural 
powers (siddhi) it merged (wināśa) into the supreme (parama) Absolute (sunya- 
tattva). The word 'disappearance' is completely out of context in this verse.
57.1. It is said that shortly thereafter when the image of Akṣobhya disappea- 
red, virtuous and learned Mahaguru of Rajyadhika undertook a pilgrimage. 57.2. He 
came to the holy statue with great devotion. This caused irritation to the abbot of 
the Candi. 57.3. The Buddhist munivara told him the real facts about the holy 
domain in the past and about the presence of the image of Akṣobhya, most subtle, 
atop (in the crown of Siva). 57.4. The Akṣobhya statue disappeared in 1331 and 
lightning struck the very interior of the candi.
The following facts emerge from the Nagarakṛtāgama: Krtanagara created 
Candi Jajawa. Its central image was that of Śiva, with a powerful statuette of
206
Navonmega

Akṣobhya in the crown. Akṣobhya was the spiritual perfection or siddhi of the
composite image. In course of time, the Akşobhya disappeared from the crown, 
probably it was removed by the Saiva abbots. The Buddhist Patriarch of Rajya- 
dhika visited the place and was dazed by the vanishing of the statuette of Akṣobhya, 
and how could he pay homage to the statue of Siva (śivarca 57.2),
As it vanished in 1331, the candi was violently struck by lightning, never to 
regain its former glory.
Nihom has tried to prove that Jaka Dolog was originally sited in Candi 
Jajawa and it was the vanished image. This misconception has arisen because of 
the Akṣobhya at this candi which was a small statuette in the crown, like the 
Akṣobhya in the Padang Roco image of Bhairava (Kempers 1959: pl. 259). The 
large-sized Jaka Dolog cannot be equated with the Akṣobhya statuette, nor can it 
obviously be this Šiva image.
Nihom's (486) proposal that "a link must exist between the disappearance of 
the Jajawa image in 1331 and the displacement of the Jaka Dolog to Majapahit 
and its rededication in 1351", is not tenable. The statuette of Aṣobhya in the 
The Jaka Dolog, consecrated by King Krta- Jajawa image disappeared for ever. 
nagara, must have become a symbol of the nation and was thus transferred to 
Majapahit. The original site of Jaka Dolog was Wurara, where it was consecrated 
by Krtanagara himself twice the second time according to the esoteric rites of 
Mahākṣobhya of mahayoga-tantras.
Nihom's translation (487) of verses 10-13 has to be amended to the following, 
excluding the ornate expressions of kavya style.
Whereas the king of the Land, the son of Harivardhana (Visnuvardhana) and 
Jayavardhani, the lord of the four islands (continents). [and yet] a sage, 
endowed with all the Truths, the best of those who know the scriptures 
(dharmaśāstra), engaged in restoration projects, the promulgator of dharma, 
[with the initiation name] Jñana-siva-vajra, adorned by a jewelline mind, 
whose limbs are purified by the rays of knowledge, conversant in the knowledge 
of Enlightenment, consecrated the image with devotion which he had earlier 
consecrated himself (in person) in the cemetry named Wurara, according to the 
rites of Mahākṣobhya.
To read the triguhya of body, speech and mind, into verses 10-12 as a system is 
straining the words too far. The triguhya are not transformed into Mahākṣobhya. 
The words atmaja and putra in verse 10 are used synonymously, without any 
extraordinary notions of descent, nor does father refer to Vajradhara as pointed out 
by Nihom (487,488). The repetition of putra in 10c is for metrical reasons. The
inscription intends to point out that Krtanagara was the son of Visnuvardhana 
207
Lokesh Chandra

from his chief queen Jayavardhani, and thus not only inherited the kingdom but
also the nobility of both parents. It is common in Indian inscriptions to name the 
mother alongwith the father, specially when she comes from a distinguished and 
renowned royal family. Jayavardhani is mentioned twice in verses 7 and 10 both 
as queen-consort and as royal mother, which means that she was from an eminent 
royal house and added lustre to her new family into which she was wedded. The 
Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta say: mahārājadhiraja śrī- 
Candraguptaputrasya-Licchavi-dauhitrasya mahadevyām Kumaradevyām utpannasya 
"son of Mahārājādhirāja Candragupta, grandson of the Licchavis, born of the Para- 
mount Queen Kumaradevi" (Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings 1981: 214-215). 
Distinguished dynastic descent of the mother added to the quasi-divine splendour 
of the king and endowed him with greater substance of kingship, the effulgence of 
deep-rooted royalty. Nihom interprets pitradhisthapanaya (verse 9) as: "Viṣṇu- 
vardhana united the land, in order to effect the firm establishment of (his) father(s)". 
I feel that this refers to Krtanagara who deposited the funeral remains of his father 
Visnuvardhana at Candi Jago, as a part of ancestral duties.
The abhiseka name of Krtangara was Jñanabajreśvara (Nag. 43. 2c), 
Jñanesvarabajra in the Singosari inscription of 1351 (P. 11), and Jnanaśivavajra in 
the Jaka Dolog inscription of Saka 1211. The word jñānavajra occurs in an 
abhişeka in Guhyasamaja-tantra 15.98. As pointed out earlier Mahākṣobhya 
refers to the mahayoga-tantra Guhyasamaja. The initiation of Krtangara must 
have been according to the rites of Guhyasamaja-tantra whose main deity is 
Akṣobhya. That is why he got the name Jñanavajreśvara 'the lord (iśvara) of 
jñānavajra' or one who has attained the full empowerment of the jñānavajra of 
Guhyasamāja. Here isvara refers to attaining the powers, the endowments, the 
puissance of Tantra rites. Iśvara also refers to a king. The Singosari inscription 
changed the sequence of the words in the compound to Jñanesvaravajra. As Iśvara 
also means Šiva, Jñān-eśvara-vajra became Jñāna-šiva-vajra in the Jaka Dolog 
inscription. It was political expedient to lay equal emphasis on the Siva-Buddha 
nexus, for after all Krtanagara attained the Sivabuddhalaya Paradise on death.
Thy synthesis of varying traditions worked out by Nihom is:
Verse 10:Krtanagara is Visņu as identical in essence with his father Visnuvar- 
dhana
As teacher of the dharma identical with Buddha
Verse 11: 
As fully conversant with the gnosis of enlightenment, he is Śiva. 
Verse 12: 
Nihom (492) himself says that it "is so palpably adventitious that it cannot be 
taken seriously. Not so: association of the trivajra with Hindu divinities may 
be found in the indubitably Buddhist Guhyasamaja. The correlations are different, 
but the idea is the same". Kaya-vajra is Brahma, väg-vajra is Maheśvara, and
208Navonmeṣa

citta-vajra is Visņu. Analogical thinking is ubiquitous in the tantras. Nihom's
correlations are remarkably ingenious but apparently forced. The verses are simple 
statements and have no symbolic pretensions. Visnuvardha in verse 10 can hardly 
refer to Visnu, for he was apotheosised as a Saiva statue at Weleri and a Buddhist 
image at Jago. Though his name begins with Visnu, he is not associated with Visnu, 
as Erlanga was, clearly evidenced by his portrait statue in the form of Visnu on 
Garuda (Kempers 1959: pl. 202). Verse II is identified with Buddha by Nihom, 
but it is too general. Nihom is working on the basis of the Hindu trinity of 
Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Siva. Nihom has overlooked that sambodhi in verse 12 
pertains to Buddha and not to Śiva. So his correlation of verse 12 with Siva is
not tenable.
Verse 13 has the expression Mahākṣobhyanurupat āḥ. Nihom to right is 
saying that the image was caused to be erected "in conformity with the essence 
(or, nature) of Mahākṣobhya. . . .In short, it [Jaka Dolog] is not Mahākṣobhya 
as such" (494). Firstly, the Jaka Dolog was consecrated earlier as an Akṣobhya. 
The inscription commemorates its second consecration according to the Guhyasa- 
māja rites. Nihom's identification of Akṣobhya with Visnu is far-fetched in the 
present context. It rests on Visņu being the first element in the name of Kṛtana- 
gara's father Visnuvardhana and Krtanagara is his "spiritual progeny (atmaja)" 
(488) atmaja from ātmā "spirit, soui". Association of ideas leads to wild 
conclusions.
Nihom "that Jaka Dolog is the reflection, call it a portrait statue proposes 
if one will, of Kertanagara as Śiva-Amoghasiddhi erected as a material reflex of 
the ineffable Mahākṣobhya" (494). Jaka Dolog was consecrated by Krtanagara 
himself. Portrait statues are done after the passing away of the person depicted. 
Hence it cannot be a portrait-statue. The Jaka Dolog is not a Šiva-Amoghasiddhi : 
it has no third eye, characteristic of Siva. Amoghasiddhi has the right hand in 
abhaya, but Jaka Dolog is in bhumi-sparśa mudra characteristic of Akṣobhya. The 
philosophical exposition of Nihom mystifies but is hardly on solid ground.
Nihom derives Wurara from hypothetical wruḍa>wrura >wurara and 
correlates it to Gahvara one of the eight cemetries in Tantric rites. The eight are a 
group and are not taken in isolation. The deity of Gahvara is Yama: Wurara 
cannot be Gahvara, because Akṣobhya has been invoked. Wurara seems to be 
the proper name of the place where the cemetery was situated.
Nihom says (495) that "Bhaṭāra Śivabuddha is of course the abhiseka name 
for Kértanagara in the Pararat on 18.15-16: siraji Kertanagara sira anjénén 
prabhu abhiseka bhaṭāra Šivabuddha". It is better to interpret the passage as : 
"Krtanagara performed his royal consecration with Sivabuddha rites". Jénén 
being in function, reign, being established" (Zoetmulder 739a).

Nihom (495) takes the Jajawa image described in the Nāgarakṛtāgama to
be Jaka Dolog. The Jajawa image was of Śiva with a statuette of Akṣobhya in 
the crown. The Jaka Dolog does not correspond to this description as already 
indicated. The identity of the two images cannot be established, and thereby 
the original site of Jaka Dolog cannot be Candi Jajawa. The three words vimbal 
bimba 'image', arca 'statue' and pratima 'likeness" are not separate semantemes : 
the three are synonyms.
Nihom (495) translates sirandhisthita sarira tan hana waneh (Nag. 56. Ic) 
"he magically estabished a physical reflex of himself, no one else". The correct 
rendering is: "he consecrated it in person and no one else", and that is why 
both the Saivas and Buddhists always worshipped the image, in deference to the 
deep reverence done to it by the King himself. In the next verse 57.2 Nihom has 
inserted the concepts of 'mundanely' and transcendentally in the translation. 
They do not occur in the original verse of the Nagarakṛtāgama. Nihom translates : 
"The mark of the shrine is that: mundanely, it is a Šaivite sanctuary, transcen- 
dentally, it has a summit which is a Buddhist sanctuary". The correct translation 
will be: "The special feature of the candi is that its lower part is Šaiva, while 
its summit portion is Buddhist". This refers to its mixed architecture, which 
must have been evolved specially because of the King's predilection. Just as the 
statue within is Šaiva crowned with a Buddhist Akşobhya, likewise is the architec- 
ture Saiva below and Buddhist above. Both the without and the within were 
equally Saiva-Buddhist. Nihom translates the second half as: "The likeness of 
Akṣobhya transcendentally forms the high point, no confusion is there at all. 
Because of its perfection in that it disappeared (the likeness) is veritably the 
supreme, the truth which is void." Again 'transcendentally' is unwarranted by 
the OJ. wording. Ruhur makuta has been mistranslated 'high point', while it 
clearly describes the image as having an Akṣobhya in the crown. The fourth 
quarter in Nihom is mystifying; we have translated it above.
Nihom (495) seems to agree with Bosch (1918b) that the replica of the Jaka 
Dolog found in Malang, was a mortuary statue of Krtanagara in Sagala. Bosch 
bases himself on Nag 43.6a. Nihom (497) places the replica image in Bureng- 
Wendit and emends the reading ring sakgala to ring sagara, and adds that we 
should await the publication of newly discovered manuscripts of the Nag. The 
word Sakgala corresponds to the Indian Sakala the capital of Madra-desa in the 
Mahabharata 2.32. The city of Sagala in the kingdom of Madda (Madra) is 
known from the Kalingabodhi-jātaka (Chalmers 1895: 4.144). The town of 
Sagala is described in Milindapanha (ed. V. Trenckner 1f.). Sakgala in Nag. is 
the name of a city, which demands identification. The image instituted at Sakgala 
is described in Nag. 43.6:
lawan rin sakgala pratiṣṭā jināwimbhatyanta rin sobhita / 
tkwan nardḍanarsewari mwań ika san cri bajradewy apupul /

THE LIFE AND WORKS OF HJAM-DBYANS-
BZHAD-PA
by
LOKESH CHANDRA
New Delhi
Hjam-dbyans-bzhad-pa I is well known for his masterly manuals of study 
(yig-cha) which are highly esteemed among the Gelukpa. These manuals 
form the academic curricula in the universities of Tibet (including Kham 
and Amdo), Inner and Outer Mongolia, Buryats, Kalmuks and other 
regions inhabited by the Mongols. They go by the name of Sgo-man 
yig-cha, and embrace every branch of Buddhist philosophy. The vast 
geographic expanse of the study of the manuals of the great Master 
entitle him to a unique position in the Lamaist world. The present short 
note intends to outline a biographic sketch of the saint-scholar and to 
give a survey of his works.
From a short life-sketch, which has been very kindly sent to me by 
Academician Dr. Rinchen of Ulanbator, we learn that Hjam-dbyans- 
bzhad-pa I¹ Nag-dban-brtson-hgrus dpal-bzan-po was born in the 
22nd Earth-Mouse year of the eleventh rab-byun cycle (1648 A.D.) in 
the area Mdo-smad Rgan-gyaḥi-ltin-rin (sic). His father was Dpal-śul- 
kha-ḥdal-dpaḥ-ḥbum-rgyal (sic) and his mother's name was Thar-mo- 
byams. At the age of seven, he studied the alphabet with his uncle

G. Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls, p. 260 n. 234. J. F. Rock, The Amnye Ma-chhen 
Range and Adjacent Regions (Rome, 1956), p. 39-41 gives the biography from Chinese
sources.
The Second Hjam-dbyans-bzhad-pa was Dkon-mchog-hjigs-med-dban-po-ye-ses- 
brtson-hgrus-grags-pahi-sde-dpal-bzan-po. He is known by his short title 'Kun-mkhyen 
sku bar-ba' (Kun-mkhyen sarvajña is the usual appellation of the Hjam-dbyans- 
bzhad-pa incarnations). His date is A.D. 1728-1791: "The Author of the Hor chos 
ḥbyun" by G. N. de Roerich, JRAS, 1946, p. 194. His works are listed by Klon-rdol 
in his Bkah-gdams-pa dan dge-lugs bla-ma rag-rim-gyi gsun-ḥbum mtshan-tho ('A 
catalogue of the works of Kadampa and Gelukpa Lamas': A Catalogue of the Tohoku 
University Collection of Tibetan Works on Buddhism, hereafter referred to as TWB 
Sendai 1953, no. 6555). See Lokesh Chandra, "The Authors of Sumbums", IIJ., II 
(1958), p. 120 no. 42. A complete list of his works will appear in the forthcoming,

bhikṣu Bsod-nams-lhun-grub, and within a short time he mastered 
reading and writing. At the age of thirteen, he become a pravrajita under 
Vinayadhara Ye-ses-rgya-mtsho. He took the vows of a śramanera (dge- 
tshul) the same scholar. He kept his vows assiduously as if they were the 
apple of his eye (mig-hbras Itar bsrun). At the age of 21, in the Ape year 
(1668 A.D.) he proceded to Tibet for his studies. He paid obeisance to 
the two Jo-bo at Lhasa. He had audience with the Panchen Lama 
Chos-kyi-rgyal-mtshan, the Dalai Lama Blo-bzań-rgya-mtsho and other 
eminent gurus. He took his final vows of a śramanera (dge-tshul) with the 
ācārya of Sgo-man college of the Drepung Monastery. In that very year 
he got admitted into the sacred Sgo-man College and devoted himself 
assiduously to his studies. Attaining the 26th year, he went to Gsan-phu 
for his degree of Dkaḥ-bcu. At the age of 27 he got his full ordination 
(bsñen-par-rdzogs-pa 'upasampanna') from the Great Fifth (Dalai Lama) 
and became a Vinayapati. From his 29th year he entered the Smad-rgyud 
College and sat at the feet of eminent masters like Acarya Blo-gros-rgya- 
mtsho, the Fifth Dalai Lama, Lcan-skya Nag-dban-chos-ldan,2 Rgyud- 
chen Dkon-mchog-yar-hphel. He heard their discourses on the Sutras 
and Tantras and became an unsurpassed scholar. From the age of 33 to 
55 he sat in meditation in the Dge-hphel ri-khrod, a cave near Drepung, 
and attained siddhi. At 53, in the Iron-Dragon year (1700 A.D.) he came 
to the See of Holy Sgo-man. He led this college to fame. At the age of 60 
he retired from this position. At the age of 62 he returned to his country 
Mdo-smad with an idea of constructing a new monastery over there. The 
following year he got the title of Erdeni nom-un qayan and a seal from the 
Fifth Dalai Lama. In that very year he constructed a new monastery at a 
place called Bkra-sis-ḥkhyil. A donor gave him a square felt tent (phyin- 
gur gru-bzhi) in which 800 people could congregate. He made it an 
assembly hall. More than 300 disciples gathered to hear the dharma. 
He made Dkaḥ-bcu-pa Nag-dban-bkra-śis the abbot of the grva-tshan. 
At the age of 69 he opened a Tantra College at Bkra-śis-ḥkhyil. At the 
age of 73 he got the title of Bstan-pa-ḥdzin-cin-skyon-bar-byed-paḥis 
Erdeni nom-un qayan and a Golden Seal from Emperor K'ang-hsi 
(Bde-skyid). From his birth to his nirvāņa he toiled for the welfare of 
beings of the universe. He wrote 15 pothis which are a nectarine subsis- 
tence for the learned in China, Mongolia and Tibet. At the age of 74, in 
the Iron-Ox year of the 12th rab-byun (1721 A.D.) he attained nirvāṇa.

Tibetan Literature.

Now we give a selective survey of the gsun-hbum or collected works of 
Hjam-dbyans-bzhad-pa I. The full titles in Tibetan will appear in the 
author's forthcoming work Materials for a History of Tibetan Literature.
The first pothi (KA) of his opera omnia begins with his short versified 
biography in 7 folios. It continues with a commentary on the vision 
(mnal-lam) of the great Tson-kha-pa (3 f.), a guide catalogue of the famous 
Dgaḥ-ldan monastery (14 f.), tables of Tibetan years (11 f.), astrological 
tables (26 f), gsol-ḥdebs of lamas (23 f.), stotras of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, 
yi-dam, and dharmapālas (20 f.), introduction to the various siddhantas 
(grub-mthah). Hence come two kavya works of 3 and 30 folios respec- 
tively. There are works on pratiṣṭhā (rab-gnas) in 94 and 9 folios, the 
eight caityas (4 f.), earth-ritual (13 f.), Nāgeśvararāja (7, 2 f.), the insertion 
of dhāraņis in images (11 f. with a supplement of 7 folios). A treatise on 
Sanskrit (legs-sbyar) (8 f.) is followed by two introductories to metrics 
(2f, 5f.). Then a fairly big commentary (ti-ka-chen) on the Kalapa (82f.), 
question-answers of the great Lotsaba Blo-bzan-hod-zer (3 f.), the crucial 
points of the four grammatical works (sgra-mdo chen-po bzhi, perhaps 
Kalapa, Candra, Sarasvata and Panini, 3f.) and a résumé on differentiating 
the three genders (5 f.). The first volume closes with a short collection of 
blessings (8 f.).
Pothi 2 (KHA) opens with essential points regarding the guruyoga 
called Dgaḥ-ldan-lha-brgya-ma¹ (6 f.) and continues with seven treatises on 
the different aspects of the Guhyasamāja like utpannakrama (55 f.), 
sampannakrama (14 f., 15 f.), and pañcakrama (13 f.). The utpannakrama 
of Samvara is dealt with in 11 folios. Six works on Vajrabhairava include 
his sampannakrama (34 f.), abhisamaya (5 f.), sevāsādhana (22 f.). 
Propitiation of the santa and krodha Mañjuśri (Vajrabhairava is the 
wrathful aspect of Mañjuśrī, TWB. no. 6004) is dealt in three treatises 
(29, 20 and 7 f.). The volume ends with question-answers of Blo-gros- 
rgya-mtsho (2f.) and an exposition of Ḥpho-badan gron-hjug (the trans- 
lation of a soul, by the efficacy of charms, from one body to another 
just vacated by death - S. C. Das, Tib. Eng. Dict. p. 849 b).
In pothi 3 (GA) the first work is on chos-hkhor (9 f.), followed by the 
method of guru-worship (23 f), a guide to the bodhipatha (51 f), 
question-answers to the big and small Lam-rim (24 f), instructions for 
the triśaranagamana (8 f.), exposition of abhiseka (dban) (14 f.), supple-

417 folios.
With pothi 6 (CHA) we come to the yig-cha or obligatory study 
manuals, which have made our author so very famous. This pothi 
contains the detailed consideration of the Vinaya in two parts, the first

113 f., V chapter 38 f., VI chapter 6 f., VII chapter 7 f., VIII chapter 
102 f. 68 f. - in the works of Chos-kyi-rgyal-mtshan also the eighth

Pothi 9 (TA) is solely devoted to the critical exposition of Madhyama- 
kāvatāra in 442 folios.
Pothi 10 (THA) contains a critical study, alongwith interpretations of 
words and meanings (tshig don mthaḥ dpyod)11 of the eight chapters of

IV chapter 127 f., V chapter 61 f., VI chapter 60 f., VII chapter 42 f.,

Pothi 11 (DA) contains a comprehensive critical study of Tson- 
kha-pa's celebrated Dran-nes¹¹ (= TWB. 6831) in 143 folios, followed by

17 f.), an exposition of the Prasannapada? (Tshig gsal) (69 f.), a general 
introduction to Vinaya (120f.) and a survey of the Four Truths (bden bzhi)

Pothi 12 (NA) contains an elucidation of the bsam-gzugs (caturdhyānas

voluminous Grub-mthah-chen-mo13 in two parts of 290 and 240 folios each.
The last pothi 15 (BA) begins with a guruyoga (16 f.), esoteric bio- 
graphical¹4 notes, etc. (5 f., 4 f., 6 f.), stotra of rgyud chen (?, 5 f.) and

a gloss on the Tibetan lexicon Nag sgron16 (42 f.), Amarakośa (Mnon-brjod 
Ḥchi-med-mdzod, 112 f. - here there is no indication of the nature of the 
work). The collected works end with a tract on monastic regulations 
(bcaḥ-yig, 4 f.).
The above collected works are detailed according to a xylographed 
dkar-chag from the library of the Ganden Monastery at Ulanbator 
(Mongolia). It was photographed by the author in 1957. The gsun-ḥbum 
is also described by Klon-rdol in his Bkah-gdams-pa dan Dge-lugs bla-ma 
rag-rim-gyi gsun-hbum mtshan-tho (TWB. no. 6555, RA of his complete 
works), folios 19a line 5 to 20b line 4. Herein the titles are nicknames and 
their order does not seem to conform to a xylographed edition. The lists 
of Klon-rdol, as a general rule, do not seem to follow any edition of the 
collected works treated, but present a very general survey.

the cursive Tibetan script by the Freedom Press, Darjeeling under the title Dpal-khan

MARA-VI JAYA-STOTRA

MARA-VI JAYA-STOTRA
The Shih-chia-mu-ni-fo-ch'êng-tao-tsai-p'u-ti-shu-hsiang- 
mo-tsan or in its Japanese pronunciation Shakamuni-butsu-jōdōzai- 
bodai ju-gōma-san (T.941: vol.19.941, S.25.15, Z.1.2.5, Bagchi 
2.638 no.28) is a transcription of a Sanskrit stotra to 
śakyamuni Buddha, by an anonymous author. Its title indicates 
that it is a stotra (san) for performing homa (goma) to the bodhi 
tree (bodai-ju). The original Sanskrit title is preserved at the 
end of the last stanza in the Chinese transliteration. Its 
transliterator into Chinese as well as the date are unknown. 
It is not found in the Ming edition of the Chinese Tripitaka 
catalogued by Nanjio. In the Taisho edition it is placed 
alongwith the works of Danapala (?, Chin. Shih-hu, Jap. Sego) who 
worked in China from 4.D. 982 to 1000. A study of the Chinese 
transliterations of Sanskrit texts by Danapala and its 
comparison with the present stotra may help us to assign a 
probable authorship, though the imperfections in reading the 
Sanskrit as discerned by the transliteration hardly warrant us 
to ascribe it to the master: Danapala.
The original Sanskrit manuscript must have been fairly 
faulty or it was read wrongly in a number of cases by the person 
transcribing it into Chinese. These misreadings can reveal the 
Indic script in which the original manuscript was written.
The misreadings are noted below:
1b nya for tya1btun for tam
10mun for mam2dham for bhum
4ato-du for ta-num5 ayi for ya
5bru for ra(in sphurad-)6aru for ra (in paṇḍura-)
6d tha for taiḥ6d
gha for mpa
7abhi for bha7cbhi for nti

7dkti for nti8dnan for naḥ
9a nan for naḥ9bbhya for tya
9c de for do9clah for lan
10b ti for ta(in sīta-)10dvan for vih (in ravih)
11b tx for nx (in nrnain)11dpun-sma for pu-spa
11d tan for tāb12anr for tra
12c ca for va (in siva-)12nal for nān ( 1n nrnām)
The Chinese transliteration of stanza 6cd leads us to the 
presumption that the Sanskrit manuscript was faded and illegible 
and that the transliterator tried to make the best of it. The 
tentative reconstruction given is:
na madasthā vasIkru nagasutaḥ
śvasitaiḥ skhalitair api kampayi tum//
But the fourth syllable should be short, which gives the 
reading tava.
In stanza 8, the Chinese transliteration has three 
miniscule characters after which correspond to lva.
This can be an alternate marginal or inserted reading from 
the original Sanskrit manuscript itself: kalya-sukham in 
which case kalya would correspond to kalyana.
The corrected text is reproduced below in Devanagari 
letters:

A NEW INDONESIAN EPISODE
OF THE MAHABHARATA-CYCLUS
Lokesh Chandra, Delhi
The Oriental Institute, Prague, has an Indonesian lontar or palmleaf 
manuscript consisting of ten leaves protected by beautifully carved wooden 
boards.* It has no title. The text ends abruptly on the tenth folio, and in 
the absence of the colophon it is not possible to specify the title. It is written 
in the Balinese script. The language is "Kawi mudha". The rest of the 
first leaf has two interesting scenes. One depicts Kunti and Pandu facing 
each other with a flower-pot in between. At the back of Pandu is Arjuna. 
The names are inscribed. The second scene shows Arjuna near the shell 
encasing Bhima with the elephant Gajahsena using all his might to break 
open the shell. Here too the name of the elephant is written. The scene is 
laid in the forest which is delineated by the foliar designs around the shell 
and on the side of the elephant.
The text is in the three metres: Sinom, Smaradahana and Pankur. The 
first seven stanzas are in Sinom, stanzas 2-25 in Smaradahana, and 26-55 
in Pankur. They are specified at the beginning of every group.
The ending of the stanzas can be located by the double dandas in the 
lontar. We have serially numbered all the stanzas in the text. The numbers 
have been indicated in the translation. The text has been kept close to the 
lontar. The important mss. readings and corruptions have been noted. Scribal 
errors like the nasalised inkan for ikan, dannawa for danawa have been 
corrected without being recorded in the footnotes. The interchange of short 
and long vowels, of the three sibilants, of the aspirates and nonaspirates, 
of cerebrals and dentals in Sanskrit words is a common phenomenon in Indo- 
nesian lontars and as much they have been left out in the present apparatus. 
Though the translation follows the original closely, it is not verbatim.**

Now we shall narrate an ancient story of the Pandawas. The name of the king was 
Pandu-dewa. He had a son who was encased in a hard shell, which could not be broken. 
So the son could not come out. He remained in the shell even till he attained the age 
of twenty-five years. By now, he had a younger brother, (2) whose name was Pārtha 
and who was also called Arjuna. Arjuna brought his elder brother to the forest Gondha- 
mahi. He put him there. He kept watch over it and resided in the watch-house. Now 
let us drop the story about the deeds of Arjuna.
Now (3) we will describe the Batareta country of the demons (yakṣa). The name 
of the daitya king was Duloma. The name of his minister commanding the armies was 
Pragalbha. He had an aide-de-camp named Kěpětmegha. (4) King Duloma asked: "What 
is lacking in the palace?" Kěpětmegha replied reverentially: "Pray, Your Majesty the 
King, nothing is lacking. Outside the palace too, people are well-provided with food and 
clothing. The danawa armies are in high spirits. (5) They are not tired of eating. 
Beasts and foxes, etc. are plentiful. Nothing is lacking. Only one thing is lacking, My

Lord: the paragon of the palace, because My Majesty did not yet think of looking for 
a queen." The Lord spoke slowly: "Hay, aide-de-camp Kěpětmegha, (6) is there any 
news about the daughter of a preeminent king?" Kěpětmegha replied: "Pray, Your 
Majesty My Lord, I have news from a merchant, a ship-captain of Java, that there is 
a daughter of the King of the Tasikmadhu country, (7) King Kratagěna. The name 
of the princess is Citrawarșiti. In charm she is like the nymph Suprabha. Several kings 
have asked for her hand, but the jewel-one has not consented. She is happy by herself 
alone." King Duloma spoke: "Oh you Kěpětmegha, she might be waiting for an affluent 
king, (8) for one like me, affluent and powerful in battle. Now I will go there to ask 
the hand of the jewel-one. If she does not accept me, I will attack her country. How 
can it escape destruction?" (9) Kěpětmegha spoke: "Pray, Your Majesty the King, 
please do not think of going there yourselfas if you have no minister. It is better that 
the minister goes." King Duloma spoke gently: "Oh minister Pragalbha, (10) you 
yourself go straightaway to the Tasikmadhu country to carry my letter. You give it 
to King Kratagena. If he refuses to give the beautyful one, then do not return." (11) The 
minister replied reverentially: "As My Lord commands. Now I take leave of Your 
Majesty." The King said: "Do go." The minister departed. He came out of the palace. 
(12) He found his army waiting. He gave them the command. All of them went thence 
flying. Their flight was like a tempest towards the Tasikmadhu country. They marched 
day and night.
Reaching Tasikmadhu, (13) they descended from the sky. They went towards the 
capital. The army of the king over there was assembled in the court by his twin son 
raden Sitawarṣita. Nothing else was being discussed (14) but his daughter dewi Citra- 
warsiti, who was not willing to marry. When they were in the midst of discussion, people 
outside were perturbed to see a host of danawas (demons) coming. One among them 
informed the king. (15) Coming in the court he said reverentially: "Pray, Your Majesty 
the King, there are many demons outside." The king said: "Oh Sitawarṣita, go and 
see them. Wherefrom and what for have they come?" (16) The twin prince went straight towards them. He got down from the Court, went near the danawas, and immediately 
on contacting them he asked: "From where are you and what is the purpose of your 
coming?" (17) Minister Pragalbha replied: "I am from the Batareta country. My name 
is minister Pragalbha, the messenger of His Majesty King Duloma by name. I want to 
hand over this letter to King Kratagena." (18) Sitawarṣita replied: "Oh minister Pra- galbha, await me for a moment. I will inform His Majesty." Sitawarṣita went away. Sitting on the stone base of the pillar, he informed the king. (19) Sitawarșita spoke reverentially: "Pray Your Majesty the King, the danawa is from Batareta, messenger of King Duloma, minister Pragalbha by name.22
The king spoke gently: "Go, ask them 
to come in." (20) Then the twin prince quickly departed. Getting down from the side 
of the harem and reaching the place where the minister was, Sitawarṣita spoke: "Oh 
Pragalbha, please come up to the court" (21) Then both of them started. They came 
up on the Court. On reaching he paid homage: "Pray Your Majesty the King, my
homage to you." The king spoke gently: "Be seated, you danawa." (22) After he sat 
down comfortably, the king spoke: "From where are you coming, and what is the pur- pose?" The minister replied: "I am, Your Majesty, from the Batareta country. I have been commissioned by my master, (23) King Duloma by name, to hand over this letter." 
The king accepted it. Then he pondered before opening the letter. [It read as follows]: 
"Oh King Kratagena, I love your daughter, (24) that charming daughter of yours, 
Princess Citrawarṣiti. If you will give her to me now, you will become greater. If you will not give her, them I will attack the Tasikmadhu country until it is turned into a forest." 
(25) King Kratagena become furious on knowing its contents. His face was glowing red. 
He tore the letter and said: "Oh Pragalbha, go back and tell your master that (26) I will 
not give her. A danawa is lower than a dog. He wants to come to attack. I am not dazzled by this threat of a fight." The minister replied: "Really you are not going to give 
her now. (27) Without delay I will carry her away by force. Your country will be 
reduced to ashes." Sitawarșita replied: "You Pragalbha, you are a swollen-head. Let's 
get down and fight in any manner you want. Don't talk much." (28) Both of them got 
down. The town-signal was sounded. The people of Tasikmadhu came agitated. They 
all fight. There was heavy fighting. They struck with spears and were struck back, they shot and were shot back. (29) Many died on both sides, men as well as demons
The demon hosts fought cruelly day and night. The people of Tasikmadhu were down 
and they were loosing. Raden Sitawarṣita went away to look for a powerful ally. (30) He 
proceeded towards the forest named Gondhamahi near the place where Arjuna was gurd-

ing his elder brother who was still in his shell, as no weapon could pierce it and break it. 
(31) Wandering about in the forest the twin-prince raden Sitawarṣita reached there and 
said: "Pray Your Highness the handsome one, I have come to beseech your help. I am 
fighting with demons. (32) If you can defeat the danawas I shall at once surrender 
to Your Highness the Tasikmadhu country." Slowly spoke Arjuna: "My dear young one, 
as you wish." Then both of them set forth (33) to the Tasikmadhu country.
To narrate the story in short, when they reached Tasikmadhu, heavy fighting was 
going on. Arjuna confronted Pragalbha. The minister spoke: (34) "I wonder who are 
you in front of me, young and handsome, different from the people of Tasikmadhu in 
appearance." Arjuna replied: "You do not know me. I am from the Pandawa (Pnawa) 
country, son of His Majesty (35) the King Pandu dewa. I am Arjuna. I want to sever 
your head." Pragalbha replied: "You are too daring, boy." Then both of them fought. 
They struck with and were struck by mace. (36) Because of the cruelty of the danawas 
Arjuna was captured and thrown up [in the air]. He fell far away. As soon as he fell 
he got up. He did not experience any pain, but he wept (37) together with his aides 
Bagong and Semar. By the grace of Bhatara, Lord Indra descended in the form of 
a very old man and said: (38) "Oh my great grandson, do not weep so bitterly because 
you have suffered defeat in fight. Such is the rule of warriors: one is defeated and 
another wins the battle. Tomorrow you take up the fight again. (39) I will give you 
an arrow to kill the demons. Confront them in the fight." Arjuna answered: "As my 
grandfather desires." After the arrow had been accepted by Arjuna, Lord Indra dis- 
appeared.
(40) Arjuna went back to face the demons. He confronted the minister who said: 
"Arjuna, you have come back again. Now is the time for you to die." (41) Straight- 
away they plunged into a fierce fight. They crushed and were countercrushed. Arjuna 
hastened to discharge that arrow of his. It cut the throat of the minister, who rolled 
down to the ground. When his hosts saw it, (42) they fled in confusion. They were 
attacked with spears from behind. When the danawas were routed, all went up to the 
Court. Arjuna was brought up. The king said: "Your Highness my dear son, (43) it is 
our good fortune that you came to our help. Now my country is entirely at your disposal." 
Arjuna said: "Pray Your Majesty my uncle, where is the bajra which is mighty power- 
ful(44) so that I can use it to break the shell of [my brother]?" The king spoke slowly: 
"Your Highness my son, even if there is a bajra sufficient for the entire globe, it will 
not pierce [the shell] of your brother, if he himself does not want it. Just wait for it, 
my son." (45) Before the talk finished, the earth quaked and rains burst forth. Heaven 
was shaken terribly. The gods were confused. The sun and the moon were dislodged. 
Bhatara Guru said: "Pray brother Narada, (46) please come down together with the 
elephant called Gajahsena, to the forest Gondhamahi and break the shell [of Bhima]." 
God Narada replied yes. Both started and descended from Heaven, (47) heading for 
the forest Gondhamahi towards that shell. Without delay they reached there. On the 
arrival of Bhatara Guru, the elephant Gajahsena took hold of the shell and threw it down. 
(48) But it did not break. Gajahsena applied all his force. He took hold of it and threw 
it down once again. After it was broken, thence came out a bearded person, (49) com- 
pletely dressed and very tall. God Narada was in front of him. Approaching him [he 
asked]: "Who is this old man?" God Narada said: "I am a god from Heaven. (50) I am 
God Narada, commissioned by my Bhaṭāra Guru to take you out of your shell. Your 
name will be Bratasena. Now you go back home (51) to the city of Hastina together 
with Arjuna." God Narada disappeared to return to Heaven. Bratasena said: "Who 
are you?" Arjuna answered: (52) "I am your younger brother, I am Arjuna." Sena 
replied: "Oh, you are my younger brother. Let us go to the city of Hastina." Arjuna 
replied: "As you desire, my elder brother." (53) Then both of them departed together 
with Garen and Petruk who followed them. Shortly after their departure they reached 
Hastina, and there Arjuna was chased. They wanted to kill him. Sena came to the 
rescue. (54) Both of them were mobbed by the Kaurawas together with that Sakuni. 
But all of them were thrown down. They fled wherever they could, some with their heads 
broken. (55) None dared to confront them...

A NEWLY DISCOVERED URGA EDITION OF
THE TIBETAN KANJUR
by
LOKESH CHANDRA
New Delhi
During his extensive travels in search of materials for the Satapitaka,¹ 
Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira undertook a journey to the Mongolian People's 
Republic (M.P.R.) at the invitation of the Committee of Sciences, 
Ulanbator. Inter alia, he discovered a hitherto unkown2 edition of the 
Tibetan Kanjur which was revised and printed in Urga during the sway 
of the eighth and last Jibcundampa (rje-btsun-dam-pa). Prof. Raghu Vira 
was told that only two copies were printed. The xylographic blocks are 
no longer extant. One copy is in the State Library at Ulanbator, and the 
other is now on the shelves of the International Academy of Indian 
Culture, New Delhi. It was presented to Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira in 
December 1955, by His Excellency Mr. U. Tsedenbal, the Prime Minister 
of the M.P.R.
The Urga Kanjur consists of 105 volumes of the size 24x48 inches 
(printed surface 20×3 inches) with seven lines to a page. This size is 
smaller than all the other known xylographic editions. According to a 
kimvadanti among the Chahars the reduction of the size of this edition 
was effected so that it could be carried on one camel, but it was an in- 
auspicious sign: it ushered the decline and the virtual extinction of the 
Law among the Khalkhas.
The volumes are listed on the last unnumbered page of the dkar-chag 
as follows:
1
The Satapitaka is a plan of the International Academy of Indian Culture founded by 
Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira for the publication of Indo-Asian literatures in original scripts 
and languages, with translations, annotations and critical evaluations. Nine volumes 
have appeared and 25 are in press or under active preparation.
2 Mr. Kenneth K. S. Ch'en furnishes details about the various editions of the Kanjur 
and Tanjur in his article "The Tibetan Tripitaka", HJAS, 9 (1946), pp. 53-62. Prof. 
G. Tucci has supplemented it in his "Tibetan Notes, 1: The Tibetan Tripitaka", HJAS, 
12 (1949), pp. 477-481. The prospectus of the photomechanic reprint of the Peking 
Kanjur and Tanjur under the editorship of Prof. D. T. Suzuki (issued by the Tibetan- 
Tripitaka Research Institute, Tokyo) has a short note on the history of the Peking 
edition. The xylographed editions of the Kanjur known to the above sources are 
tabulated below:

This list tallies exactly with the set of volumes at the Academy. All its 
cardboard (not wooden) covers have the division headings (e.g. hdul-ba, 
hbum) in the Mongolian language side by side with Tibetan, both 
written by hand.
The dkar-chag or catalogue of this edition consists of 75 folios. Two 
folios bear the number 10 (bcu gon and bcu hog); the penultimate folio 
containing the list of volumes and the last folio illustrating the four 
lokapālas are unnumbered: so the folio numbers in Tibetan words run 
up to 72. As usual with Mongolian xylographs, the obverse of most 
folios has the number in figures preceded by the marginal title dkar-chag.

Hereafter we give a resumé of the important data from the dkar-chag. 
[1b1] After the opening mangalavacana in Sanskrit (namo gurumunin- 
drāya), there are 14 Tibetan stanzas of salutation to the eminent Jewels of 
the Faith. The first stanza invokes the blessings of His Supreme Holiness 
the Jibcundampa Nag-dban-blo-bzan-chos-kyi-ñi-ma-bstan-ḥdzin,* in the 
classical rhetorical style with double entendre on the name of His Supreme 
Holiness. The ensuing stanzas are an obeisance to Lord Buddha (st. 2), 
Mi-pham mgon, Mañjuśrīguhyapati, the Six Jewels of India" (rgyan drug), 
the two Eminent Ones (mchog gñis) and others (st. 3), spyod-paḥi rdo-rje 
(st. 4), to the lotsabas and panditas (lo-pan) who enriched the world by 
their translations of the invaluable Jewels of the Law from India (st. 5), 
Atīsa, his disciple Ḥbrom-ston, the eminent bkaḥ-gdams-pa teachers 
(st. 6), to the Second Jina (rgyal-ba gñis, i.e. Tson-kha-pa) along 
with his disciples (st. 7), Hjam-dbyans-chos-rje (st. 8), the successive 
incarnations of the Dalai Lamas (st. 9) and Panchen Lamas (st. 10), the 
[first] Jibcundampa Blo-bzań-bstan-pahi-rgyal-mtshan who upholds the 
illustrious Law of Jina Sumati[kirti] (Blo-bzan rgyal-ba, i.e. Tson-kha-pa) 
(st. 11), and his successive incarnations (st. 12), and to the [last Jibcun- 
dampa] Nag-dban-blo-bzan-chos-kyi-ñi-ma-bstan-ḥdzin-dban-phyug (st. 
13). The final stanza is a general invocation to all the Upholders of the 
Doctrine to protect the Law.

unimpeded completion of any work. According to this classical tradition, 
the authors of the dkar-chag finally proceed to give the spro-tshig: 
it is a great pleasure to commence the catalogue of the complete 
Kanjur which is being xylographed in this country of Mongolia by the 
grace of Rje-btsun-dam-pa Chos-kyi-ñi-ma, and which is entitled "Bkra- 
śis dge-mtshan spel-bar-byed-pa yi skye-ba Ina-paḥi sgra-dbyans."
On folio 3a line 6 the subjects to be set forth in the catalogue are 
enumerated as four:
§ 1. How the Kanjur was collected and redacted in Tibet, etc. (Gans-can- 
gyi ljons sogs su...).
§ 2. How the Law was propagated in the country of the Khal-khas." 
§ 3. How this edition was prepared for print.
§ 4. The detailed list of titles (them-byan), ending with the final 
auspicious embellishments (bsno smon btab-pa dan bkra-śis-kyis mthaḥ 
brgyan-paho).
[3b1] § 1. The incomparable Teacher Munindra (Lord Buddha) having 
become fully enlightened proclaimed the Law, which is auspicious in the 
beginning, middle and end, to all the worlds. The words of the Lord 
were proclaimed to the devas, nāgas, gandharvas, men and innumerable 
other beings according to their inherent natures in their respective 
languages. Their expanse and depth is incomprehensible even for the 
śrāvakas, pratyekajinas, caramabhavika Bodhisattvas (srid-pa-tha-ma-pa, 
cf. Mvy. 7003); nothing to speak about common men. From this vast 
ocean a few drops were gathered by the noble arhats at three occasions 
(i.e. the Three Councils), by the Six Jewels, the two Eminent Ones, the 
eighty (sic) mahāsiddhas, and numerous other noble personages. The 
streams of preaching, study, and meditation converged in the great 
Anavatapta lake and thence they flowed into Tibet (bsil-ldan-gyi-ljons- 
chen-po) in the form of the mighty river of Sutras and Tantras (mdo 
rgyud). By the grace of the incarnations of the Three Protecting Lords 
Avalokitesvara, Vajrapāņi and Mañjusfi, the three dharmarajas, etc., the 
King and Minister, and the lotsabas and panditas, the Holy Words (gsun 
rab) which have been brought to Tibet (kha-ba-can-gyi-ljons) and trans- 
lated, were collected together and became known as the Bkah-hgyur.

the dkar-chag, without any alterations.
8 The precise date of Sad-na-legs is not settled. Dr. L. Petech, A Study on the Chroni- 
cles of Ladakh, p. 62, assigns him to 797-804 A.D. Also see ibid., p. 74 ff. According 
to the Deb-ther-snon-po it is 804-814 A.D. (Indo-Tibetica, IV, part II, p. 283). Also see

works that were deposited in the Ḥphan-than-ka-med monastery (gtsug- 
lag-khan vihara, Mvy. 9152), giving the title, number of bam, leḥu, and 
ślokas. This became famous as the Ḥphan-than-ma Catalogue. It is 
famed that this was the first effort in Tibet (Gans-can) to collect together 
the entire (ro-cog) Kanjur.

others collected together, arranged and catalogued holy works kept in the 
great palace (pho-bran chen-po) of Ston-thad-ldan-dkar.11 It became known 
as Ldan-dkar-ma.12
[4a5] At the time of the preparation of these big catalogues the mystic 
(profound?) tantras (gsan-snags nan-gi rgyud sde zab-mo-rnams) were not 
included in the detailed lists (them-byan) because of their secret practices. 
At the time of the later propagation of the Doctrine (bstan-pa phyi-dar) 
the lotsabas translated and added several sūtras and tantras to the 
numerous already extant. But no catalogue (dkar-chag) was produced. 
[4b1] Later¹³ the disciple of Bcom-ldan-rig-ral, Mchims Hjam-dbyans, 
9 Dpal-brtsegs was "one of the two famous lotsābas in the times of King Khri-sron- 
Ide-btsan" TPS, p. 680, n. 41. The date of Khri-sron-lde-btsan is 755-797 A.D. (Dr. 
L. Petech, A Study on the Chronicles of Ladakh, p. 62).

Bu-ston in his chos-ḥbyun (Obermiller, History of Buddhism, part II, p. 191) also 
writes about this catalogue.
12 Prof. S. Yoshimura of the Ryukoku University, Kyoto, has published The Denkar- 
ma Catalogue. This catalogue has also been published by Marcelle Lalou, JA, 1953, 
pp. 313-353.
13 This attempt is described at length in the Deb-ther-snon-po cha 5b7-6b1 in my xylo- 
graph. This passage has been discussed by Prof. G. Tucci in "Tibetan Notes", HJAS, 
12 (1949), pp. 477-478, and TPS, p. 107 f., and translated by Dr. G. de Roerich in Blue 
Annals, part 1, pp. 337-339. There are some discrepancies in them. As this passage is 
of importance for the history of the redaction of the Tibetan Canon, it is being quoted

(xylograph: pakşi) collected resources from China and Mongolia (Rgya 
Sog). To prepare a complete copy of the Kanjur he collected a lot of 
originals (ma-phyi) through his strenuous efforts. Having corrected and 
arranged them thoroughly with the help of various scholars, Sakyabhikṣu 
Ḥjam-paḥi-dbyans placed it in the great vihara of dpal Snar-than and 
prepared a catalogue (dkar-chag). This came to be known as the 
Narthang Kanjur (Snar-than Bkaḥ-ḥgyur).

(a) Prof. Tucci, ibid., p. 477 says: "bTsun-pa hJams-dbyans, a disciple of sKyo-ston 
bCom Ral-khri... sent to dBus-pa Blo-gsal a large amount of money in order to have 
a copy of the bsTan-hgyur and bKah-ḥgyur printed and placed in the temples of sNar- 
than." This passage needs reconsideration. Hjam-dbyans was a disciple of Bcom- 
ldan-rig-pahi-ral-gri (not "khri; also known as Bcom-ral and Bcom-Idan-pa), who in 
turn may be said to be a disciple of Skyo-ston-pa (Blue Annals, part 1, p. 336-37). The 
guru-parampara may be worked out as:
Skyo-ston-pa
Bcom-Idan-rig-pahi-ral-gri (or Bcom-ral, Bcom-Idan-pa, Rig-ral)
btsun-pa (= Venerable) Ḥjam-dbyans
Dbus-pa Blo-gsal-byan-chub-ye-ses (or Blo-gsal)
Further Ḥjam-dbyans had sent money for the preparation, and not printing, of a copy 
of the Canon.
(b) The word phyi-mo is rendered by Prof. Tucci as "supplementary texts". Dr. 
Roerich translates it as "original texts", which is better suited to the present context. 
Compare the use of phyi-mo later in the passage under discussion: de-la phyi-mo bgyis-te 
gzhis-kha Rin-spuns-su. . ., de-la phyi-mo byas-te Gon-dkar dan, and other sentences 
where it certainly cannot be translated as "supplementary texts". The dkar-chag of the 
Urga edition uses the word ma-phyi instead of phyi-mo. According to S. C. Das, 
Tibetan-English Dictionary, p. 945a s.v. ma II: "the original of any document or book is 
termed the ma-gzhi or a-ma while the copy of the same is styled the bu 'son' or bu-dpe". 
In Kasyapaparivarta 89 (ed. Baron A. von Staël-Holstein), Dasábhumika-sutra 1N 
(ed. J. Rahder), and Prasannapadă 359.11 (J. W. de Jong, Cinq chapitres de la Prasanna- 
padă, p. 98) yi-geḥi-phyi-mo is the translation of Sanskrit mātṛkā.

183AN URGA EDITION OF THE TIBETAN KANJUR
[463] With this as the original (ma-phyi), Tshal-pa Si-tu Dge-baḥi-blo- 
gros15 had [a copy prepared] and placed in the Tshal gun-than vihara. To 
the original (i.e. Narthang) were added other texts. This is known as the 
Tshal-pa Kanjur (Tshal-pa Bkah-hgyur). Because of its great authenti- 
city (śin-tu khuns-btsun)16 it became very famous. Bu-ston thams-cad- 
mkhyen-pa rin-chen-grub came for its pratiṣṭhā (rab-gnas).¹7 Having 
corrected it according to the three criteria (dpyad-pa gsum)18 together 
with Si-tu Dge-baḥi-blo-gros,15 he made it the sole writ of the holy Law. 
[4b6] Later on the red-cap (zhva-dmar) Chos-kyi-grags-pa,19 rje Ye- 
bzan-brtse-ba, and others revised it so that it may be incomparably 
correct so say the big catalogues.
[5a1] According to the Derge Catalogue, the king of Hjan Karma 
Mi-pham-bsod-nams-rab-brtan took the Tshal-pa Kanjur, and as concerns 
the tantra division, he compared also the Stag-lun-rgyud-'bum. The sixth 
red-cap (zhva-dmar drug-pa)20 revised it. Then it was printed (par-du
(c) Dr. Roerich takes Grom-pa Sa-skya as one word. Prof. Tucci, ibid., p. 478, has: 
"Gom-pa, Sa-skya".
(d) Prof. Tucci, ibid., p. 478, has Tshal, but Dr. Roerich has the same reading as our 
xylograph.
(e) Prof. Tucci and Dr. Roerich render it as "about a thousand". Can it mean "over a 
thousand" (?)
(f) Prof. Tucci spells rTse-than.
(g) Prof. Tucci: "hence new additions and new copies"; this is due to interpreting 
phyi-mo as "supplementary texts" or the like. But see supra note b.
(h) Prof. Tucci: mThon-ba-ldon-ldan, and Dr. Roerich: mThon-ba Dun-ldan-pa. 
(i) Dr. Roerich reads it as Dun-ben Sa-ba. Prof. Tucci is right in interpreting du-dben-sa 
as the Chinese title tu-yüan-shihi conferred on Tibetan dignitaries. 
(k) Prof. Tucci: Chos-rje-ran-byun. Chos-rje is the title, and not an integral part of the 
name; it is clear from its termination -s (chos-rjes). Our xylograph has Ḥtshur-phu 
while Prof. Tucci's mTshur-phu.

noble descent, or when applied to statements, etc.: 'well-founded'."

honourable, all-knowing, Dge-baḥi-blo-gros. He invited in Tshal Bu-ston, the prince

[5a3] The dharmaraja of Rgyal-rtse prepared a copy on the basis of the 
Snar-than Kanjur. Bu-ston (thams-cad-mkhyen-pa Bu-ston rin-po-che) 
having examined it according to the three criteria (dpyad-pa gsum) 
corrected it and also prepared a catalogue. On some points (this 
catalogue) disagrees with Ven. Bu-ston's chos-hbyun, and for this reason 
it is often considered that the author of Them-dpan-ma (the catalogue 
of the Rgyal-rtse Kanjur) was Lo-chen Thugs-rje-dpal. Whatever 
be the authorship, the catalogue was so correct and complete that 
its authenticity was accepted by all and it came to be known as Them- 
dpan-ma.21
[5a5] All the Kanjur editions which have been xylographed (par-du- 
ḥkhod-pa) on the basis of the Tshal-pa Kanjur and the Rgyal-rtse 
Them-dpan-ma are given below:
[5a6] The Chinese Emperor Yung-lo (Tsi-nahi yul-du gon-ma ta-min 
Gyun-lo-chen-po) invited rje-bdag-ñid-chen-po, but Byams-chen-chos-rje 
Śakya-ye-śes22 went in his place, and exerted himself for the propagation 
of the doctrine of Tsonkhapa, so that it may spread in all directions and 
last for a long time. Through his grace the Emperor had excellent copper 
blocks (zans-par) of the complete Tibetan Kanjur prepared for the first 
time.
[5b1] The Mtshal-pa Kanjur prepared by the Chinese Emperor K'ang- 
hsi (Bde-skyid).
The Li-than-Mtshal-pa Kanjur prepared by Sa-tham king Mi-pham- 
bsod-nams-rab-brtan.23
The Snar-than Kanjur prepared by Mi-dban Bsod-nams-stobs-rgyas 
during the time of Dalai Lama VII.24
The Cone Kanjur prepared by Mi-dbań Dmag-zor Mgon-po-rgyal 
during the time of Co-ne-grags-pa Bśad-sgrub.
sixth will be Dkon-mchog-chos-kyi-ñi-ma (11th in Klon-rdol-bla-ma's list given in 
TPS, p. 682b).

Dpan means "a witness, one able to attest or bear witness; also, a surety" (S. C. 
Das, Tib.-Eng. Dict.). In Dasabhumika 10J, 11E dpan-du-bzhugs-te (11E gyur pa) 
renders the Skt. sākṣibhūta. In the present context dpan should mean authentic. 
22 "Sa-kya-ye-ses is one of Tson-kha-pa's most celebrated disciples who died in the 
year 1435 at the age of 82". (TPS., p. 253b, note 62). According to TPS. p. 25 he was 
"better known by the name of Byams sems rdo rje" but our dkar-chag gives it as 
Byams-chen-chos-rje.
23 It is the same edition as already described above (our dkar-chag folio 5a1).

185AN URGA EDITION OF THE TIBETAN KANJUR
[5b3] The Derge Kanjur prepared by Mi-dban Bstan-pa-tshe-rin during 
the time of Si-tu-pan-chen.
Sin-bzaḥ-pandi-ta Blo-bzan-dar-rgyas had the entire Kanjur xylographed 
(par-du bzhens-pa) during the time of Pan-chen Blo-bzan-dpal-ldan- 
bstan-paḥi-ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal.25 Similarly other editions fur- 
thered the spread of the Law.
[564] Lord Buddha proclaimed the eightyfour thousand dharmaskan- 
dhas for the eightyfour thousand afflictions. Among them some have 
been translated into Tibetan, while others not. Among the translated are 
the earlier and later translations (sna-hgyur phyi-hgyur). Besides, there 
are the biographies (rnam-thar) and annals (lo-rgyus) of the panditas 
(pan-grub) and great lotsabas (lo-chen). In Tibet is the earlier and later 
propagation of the Law (sna-dar phyi-dar). Among them are the Sa-[skya], 
Rñin-[ma-pa], Kar-[ma-pa], Ḥbrug-[pa], Jo-lugs (= Jo-nan-pa), Bu-lugs, 
old and new (gsar-rñin) Bkaḥ-gdams-pa and numerous other denomina- 
tions. The biographies, annals, etc. have been given in the big catalogues 
and hence they have been omitted here.
[5b7] § 2. How the Law has been propagated in the Khal-kha country. 
Here our dkar-chag refers to the prophecy in the Ḥdus-rgyud about 
Lhan-cig-skyes-pahi-dgah-ba, Ye-ses-rdo-rje, and others. It further 
mentions the prophecy in the Ḥdus-rgyud-phyi-ma about Ye-ses-mthaḥ- 
can-nag-po, Ma-dhu-ma-ti-srin-poḥi-dban-po, Ye-ses with a vajra and 
ghanță in hand, and Nag-po holding a kha-ṭvām-ga, rus-rgyan can-teu 
and chan-snod. The dkar-chag goes on to quote from a sutra that in the 
future in the world called Ni-zla-skar-mahi-hod will incarnate the 
Tathāgata called Gaganatilaka (Nam-mkhahi-thig-le) to lead all beings to 
mokṣa and to all-knowledge. According to this prophecy skal~26 
skyabs-mgon rje-btsun-dam-pa Blo-bzań-bstan-pahi-rgyal-mtshan-dpal- 
bzan-po, the God of all beings of this northern land, incarnated in this 
Khal-kha country which was drowned in darkness in the absence of the 
light of the Law. In ornate style the dkar-chag goes on to relate that with 
him the country was enriched by several big and small monasteries. He 
made this country like the Aryadeśa (Hphags-pahi-yul). By the holy acts of 
the successive incarnations of the Jibcundampas the Law attained greater 
and greater heights like the waxing of the moon of the bright fortnight.

[9a3] The work of carrying out corrections and additions was accom- 
plished under the supervision of Mkhan-po-no-mon-han by various 
chos-rje (dharmasvamins) and the following scholars selected by H. H. 
the Jibcundampa himself: Dar-pa-pandi-ta gabcu (= dkaḥ-bcu) Nag-

dge-bśes's compared the Derge and Chinese editions (Sde-dge-par-mar 
Rgya-par-ma gñis). After exerting themselves hard for three years they 
corrected it to perfection (legs-par zhus-dag mdzad-pa).

34 Dge-bskos=upadhivärika (Mahävyutpatti, Sakaki's ed., no. 9067). 
35
Gñer-pa "bhāṇḍarī, a storekeeper" (S. C. Das). Mahāvyupatti (Sasaki's ed.) 3739 
gives se sapatiḥ for gñer-ba. Seşapati is interpreted as "a certain royal officer: Mvy. 
3739 Tib. gñer-ba administrator" by Edgerton, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary. 
Seşapati is not a royal officer, but a monastic administrator, lower than dge-(b)skos. 
According to Lama Chimpa, he is in charge of board and lodging.
36
Dar-ga stands for Mongolian daruya. A. Mostaert, Dictionnaire Ordos, gives no 
ecclesiastic meaning. According to Lama Chimpa, dar-ga is a monastic inspector.

Dge-yyog is a youth attending upon a monk who works with a view to enter the 
holy order. When he has passed the prescribed examination for admission, he gets the 
position of a dge-gzhon (S. C. Das, Tib.-Eng. Dict.).
38
Ja-ma "tea-maker, tea-cook, a cook who prepares tea and gruel, etc." (S. C. Das, 
Tib.-Eng. Dict.). In Mongolia, ja-ma supervised the preparation of tea. He was a 
monastic official with several cooks under him (Lama Chimpa).

[10(1)b5] Thus by the exertions of the aforesaid persons this work was 
completed in the properous and pious land of northern Mongolia. Here 
the dkar-chag gives epithets after epithets as to how the country was 
sanctified by religious observances. One of the interesting epithets 
[10(2)a3] is that it resounded with the voice of thousands of men of 
erudition studying and teaching the three pitakas (sde-snod-gsum 
Tripitaka) and the four classes of tantras.
[10(2)a5] In the second year of the accession of Hsüan-t'ung
i.e. the 44th Iron-Dog year called Sadhāraṇa in the Bṛhaspati-cycle 
(i.e. 1910 A.D.), ten thousand monks (rab-byun =pravrajita) vowed 
to reside together for the varṣāvāsa (dbyar-gnas-pa) in the great monastery 
of Khu-re-chen-mo alias Ri-bo-dge-rgyas-dgaḥ-ldan-bśad-sgrub-glin, 
which is the source of the Law for this Northern Land (i.e. Mongolia). 
Besides, a new monastic college (grva-tshan) Yid-dgah-chos-ḥdzin-glin 
was founded to impart instruction according to the yig-cha of Rje-btsun- 
pa. Thus the whole year was replete with auspicious activities. Hereafter 
follow five ornate stanzas adoring H.H. the Jibcundampa for his numer- 
ous acts for the propagation of the Law.
[11a1] § 4. The dkar-chag is divided into two parts: sūtra (mdo) and 
tantra (snags). The first part (sutra) is subdivided into (i) vinaya (hdul-ba- 
lun-gi skor), (ii) prajñāpāramitā (ses-phyin-gyi skor), (iii) sūtra (mdo- 
gzhun bzhugs tshogs che-baḥi skor), and (iv) sūtränta (mdo-man) which 
includes the Hinayana and Mahāyāna sūtras. The dkar-chag discusses 
the various classifications of the Vinaya. It is arranged by Bu-ston as: 
Bhiksu-prātimokṣa and vibhanga (phahi so-thar dan rnam-ḥbyed), 
Bhiksuņi-prātimokṣa and vibhanga (mahi so-thar dan rnam-hbyed), 
Vinayavastu (lun-gzhi), Kṣudraka (phran-tshegs), Uttaragrantha? (lun- 
zhu-pa). According to Gon-dkar-pa the order is: the two Prātimokṣas

AN URGA EDITION OF THE TIBETAN KANJUR191
(so-thar gñis), Vinayavastu (lun-gzhi), Vibhanga (rnam-hbyed), Uttara- 
grantha? (zhu-ba), Kṣudraka (phran-tshegs).
But in this edition the order of the Tshal-pa Kanjur has been retained, 
which is based on the old catalogue Hphan-than-ma: Vinayavastu 
(hdul-ba-gzhi), Bhikṣu-prātimokşa and vibhanga (phaḥi so-thar dan rnam- 
hbyed), Bhikṣuni-prātimokṣa and vibhanga (maḥi~), Kṣudraka (phran- 
tshegs), Uttaragrantha (gzhun bla-ma). The Vinayavastu has 17 vastus, is 
well-known as lun-gzhi, has 32.700 ślokas and 109 bam-pos.
Hereafter the detailed list begins. It gives the precise location of every 
text: the volume-letter (ka, kha, etc.), preceded by the folio number, its 
recto or verso, and line. The sub-titles are also indicated, e.g. the 17 vastus 
of the Vinayavastu (folios 11a5 et seq.). The list of titles comes to an end 
on folio 72a2. Then comes the final mangalācaraṇa in stanzas, ending 
with Om ye dharma hetuprabhavā, etc.
According to Prof. Dr. Rinchen, the par-yig of the Urga edition of the 
Tanjur was complete in 1937. Some volumes were carved and even 
printed. It is likely that some of them may be found among the arats in 
remote habitations of the Mongolian People's Republic.

NT LAKANTHA LOKESVARA AS THE BUDDHIST APOTHEOSIS OF HARI-HARA
Hsuan-tsang refers to Avalokitesvara on the Potala in the 
following words (Beal 1884:2.233): "To the east of the Malaya 
mountains is Mount Po-ta-lo-kia (Potalaka). The passes of this 
mountain are very dangerous; its sides are precipitous, and its 
valleys rugged. On the top of the mountain is a lake; its waters 
are clear as a mirror. From a hollow proceeds a great river which 
encircles the mountain as it flows down twenty times and then enters 
the southern sea. By the side of the lake is a rock-palace of the 
Devas. Here Avalokitesvara in coming and going takes his abode. 
Those who strongly desire to see this Bodhisattva do not regard 
their lives, but, crossing the water (fording the streams), climb 
the mountain forgetful of its difficulties and dangers; of those 
who make the attempt there are very few who reach the summit. But 
even of those who dwell below the mountain, if they earnestly pray 
and beg to behold the god, sometimes he appears as Tsz'-tsai-t'ien 
(Isvara-deva), sometimes under the form of a yogi (a Pasupata); he 
addresses them with benevolent words and then they obtain their 
wishes according to their desires".
Watters (1905:2.229) summarises the above passage as follows: 
"In the south of the country near the sea was the Mo-lo-ya (Malaya) 
mountain, with lofty cliffs and ridges and deep valleys and gullies, 
on which were sandal, camphor and other trees. To the east of this 
was Pu-ta-lo-ka (Potalaka) mountain with steep narrow paths over its 
cliffs and gorges in irregular confusion; on the top was a lake of 
clear water, whence issued a river which, on its way to the sea, 
flowed twenty times round the mountain. By the side of the lake 
was a stone Deva-palace frequented by Kuan-tzu-tsai P'usa. Devotees, 
risking life, brave water and mountain to see the P'usa, but only 
a few succeed in reaching the shrine. To the people at the foot of 
themountain who pray for a sight of the P'usa, he appears some- 
times as a Pasupata TTrthika, or as Mabesvara, and consoles the

2
suppliant with this (sic) answer".
Hsuan-tsang must have read in the Avatamsaka-sutra about the 
earthly paradise of Avalokitesvara: "Potalaka is on the sea-side in 
the south, it has woods, and streams, and tanks, and is in fact a 
sort of earthly paradise. Buddhabhadra (A.D.420) calls Kuanyin's 
mountain Kuang-ming (A) or 'Brilliance', which is usually 
given as the rendering for Malaya, but a later translator, 
Sikshananda, transcribes the name Potalaka" (Watters 1905:2.231). 
Buddhabhadra's rendering of Potala is 'Brilliance'. It refers to 
its etymology: Tamil pottu (potti-) 'to light (as a fire)', Kota 
pot- (poty-) id., Kannada pottu n. 'flaming, pottige 'flaming, flame, 
Tulu potta 'hot, burning' (Burrow/Emeneau 1961:298 no.3691). In 
Kannada analogous words are: pottige 'flaming, flame', potti su t 
to burn 
cause to burn with flame, to kindle, to light', pottu 'to begin with 
flame, to be kindled, to catch fire, to flame', pottu 1. flaming, 
2. the sun, 3.time' (Kittel 1894:1020). In ancient times the magni- 
ficence of the temple of Avalokitesvara must have been resplendent 
and dazzling to the devotees who reached it after negotiating in- 
accessible cliffs and ravines: a transcendence beyond forbidding 
barriers.
In the above passage Avalokitesvara at Potala sometimes take 
the form of Isvara (śiva) and sometimes that of a Pasupata yogin. In 
fact Śiva was metamorphosed into Avalokitesvara. 
This is corroborated 
by the Nflakanthaka and Nlakantha-dharani where Nilakantha Lokesvara 
is an apotheosis of Siva and Visņu (Hari-Hara). The NTlakanthaka was 
translated into Chinese by three masters in the seventh and early 
eighth century: by Chih-t'ung twice during A.D.627-649 (T.1057a and 
T.1057b = Nj.318), by Bhagavaddharma during A.D.650-660 (T.1059 and 
T.1060 = Nj.320), and by Bodhi ruci in A.D.709 (T.1058 800Nj.319).
The Nilakantha-dharani was translated into Chinese by Vajra- 
bodhi (worked A.D.719-741, T.1112), twice by his disciple Amoghavajra 
(worked A.D.723-774, T.1111, 1113b), and in the fourteenth century 
by Dhyanbhadra (worked A.D. 1326-1363, T.1113a).

3
Twelve scrolls of Mlakantha Lokesvara texts in Chinese have 
been found at Tun-huang (Giles 1957:105-106). Manuscript 3793 of the 
Stein Collection of Chinese scrolls from Tun-huang adds a note at the 
end: 'Translated at Khotan by the śramana Bhagavaddharma of Western 
India'. Here West means 'South India' as we have already pointed out 
in our article on Oddiyana (in print). It is notable that Bhagavad- 
aa
dharma accomplished the translation at Khotan. NT1kandi for Nilkantha 
in Amoghavajra's translation (T.1113b), is a Central Asian form: 
Uigur nominative singular ending in 1.
AMOGHAVAJRA'S VERSI ON
The version of Amoghavajra (T.1113B) has been the most wide- 
spread ever since it was written in the eighth century. Its popula- 
rity has not waned to this day. Suzuki (1950:22-23) includes its 
English rendering as an essential part of the Zen repertoire of 
sutras, "what the Zen monk reads before the Buddha in his daily 
service, where his thoughts move in his leisure hours" (ibid.11):
DHARANI OF THE GREAT COMPASSIONATE ONE
Adoration to the Triple Treasure!
Adoration to Avalokitesvara the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who is the 
great compassionate one!
Om, to the one who performs a leap beyond all fears!
Having adored him, may I enter into the heart of the blue-necked 
one known as the noble adorable Avalokitesvara. It means the comple-
ting of all meaning, it is pure, it is that which makes all beings 
victorious and cleanses the path of existence.
Thus:
Om, the seer, the world-transcending one!
O Hari the Mahabodhisattva!
All, all!
Defilement, defilement!
The earth, the earth!
It is the heart!
Do, do the work!
Hold fast, hold fast!
O great victor!
Hold on, hold on!
I hold on!
To Indra the creator!
Move, move, my defilement-free seal!
Come, come!
Hear, hear!

Suzuki has used the Sanskrit text in Siddham script given along- 
side the Chinese trancription, as the basis for his translation. The 
Sanskrit is corrupt beyond recognition in certain cases: dhava namo 
narakidhi herima. Suzuki has taken '0 Hari' from another version. 
sarva'all, all', is in fact sarpa2 'descend2'. Mala2 translated 
2 by Suzuki ás 'defilement, defilement! should be smara 'bear in 
mind². dhirini-raya is rendered as 'I hold on. 
To Indra the 
creator'. Its correct Sanskrit is dharini-raja '0 Lord of the 
dharani (namely, NTlakantha Loke śvara)'. Vasa-vasam prasaya is done 
into English as 'Speak! speak! Directing'. Its Sanskrit reconstruc- 
2
tion is visam pranasaya 'destroy every poison (of the senses)'. 
dhasinina pasamana svaha is interpreted as 'of daring one, to the 
joyous, hail'. Its correct text would be [dehi me darsanam/ 
praharamanaya svaha 'appear [unto me7. To the overlooking Lord, 
hail'. Suzuki has missed not only the words of the dharani, but also 
its structure. The dharani can be divided into five parts: 1.initial 
salutation, 2. name of the Avalokitesvara, 3. sloka enunciating merits

5
of the hṛdaya-dharani, 4. dharani commencing with the classical 
phrase tadyatha, 5. final salutation. It escaped the attention of 
Suzuki that the third part is a sloka.
The text as written in Siddham script in the Chinese Tripitaka 
(T.1113B, 20.498-501) is transcribed below:

The above text can be corrected by a cemparison with the 
version of Chih-t'ung (worked A.D.627-649); which we find in the Ming 
edition of the Chinese Tripitaka. All the Sanskrit texts occurring 
in the Ming Tripitaka were collected together by Rol-paḥi- rdo-rje 
and his assistants in 8+2 volumes of the quadrilingual collection of 
dharanis which bears the Chinese title: Yü chih man han mêng-ku hsi- 
fan ho-pi ta-tsang ch'üan chou (edited by the author in 22 volumes 
under the title Sanskrit Texts from the Imperial Palace at Peking, 
abbreviated to STP). The prime objective of the redactors of the 
quadrilingual dharani-collection was to restore the Sanskrit text to 
its appropriate accuracy with the help of Tibetan texts. It proved

6
to be a remarkable effort at textual reconstruction undertaken as 
early as the first half of the 18th century.
Herebelow is the reconstituted Sanskrit text with variant 
readings from STP.5.1290-6.1304 which have been used for emenda- 
tions:

expletive to slur over lacunae when words were forgotten.
3STP. Aloka-adhi pati: this reminds us of Buddhabhadra (A.D.420) 
who renders Potalaka the mountain of Avalokitesvara as Kuang-ming 
"Brilliance". The Avalokitesvara of Potalaka was Alokadhi pati or 
the Lord of Effulgence, and this phrase points to the fact that

11 STP.1301 line 2 vajrahastaya.In the Siddham of the Chinese
text it is pama which can equally well be gadā. The dharani refers 
to Varaha and Narasimha, the two incarnations of Visņu. The attri- 
butes that follow should also pertain to Visņu: mace (gada), discus 
(cakra), lotus (padma) and conch (sankha). In this light pama has 
to be emended to gadā and not to vajra.
12 STP.1302 lines 3-4 cakrayudharaya svaha / sankha-gabda- 
nibodhanaya svaha. The sankha 'conch' is missing in our text.
13Hsüan-tsang says that the Avalokitesvara at Potalaka some- 
times appears as a yogin smeared with ashes. The word pandaraya is 
an allusion to this attribute.

CHIH-TUNG'S VERSI ON
Now we shall take up Rol-pahi-rdo-rje's reconstruction 
(STP.5.1290-6.1304) of the Nilakanṭhaka as transcribed by Chih-t'ung 
during A.D.627-649 (Nj.318, T.1057b). This version is different and 
longer than that of Amoghavajra. The words ehi hare (hare is the 
are 
vacative of Hari) and ehi hara of crucial importance, as they are 
A
certain indications that the Potala image was a syncretic icon of 
Hari (Vişnu) and Hara (siva). Hari-hara Lokeśvara is one of the 108 
forms of Avalokitesvara in the Macchandar Vahal at Kathmandu in Nepal 
(Bhattacharyya 1958:429 no.84). The following characteristics allude 
to Hari padma-hasta, Vajra-hasta, cakrayudhadhara, sankha-sabda- 
nirghosana. These are the attributes held in the four hands of 
Visnu, except vajra which replaces gadā. He has the faces of two 
incarnations of Visnu: Varaha-mukha, MahaVaraha-mukha, Narasimha- 
mukha, MahaNarasimha-mukha. He has the prowess of Narayana
(Narayana-bala-rupa). He is Hara-Hari (Hara-hare, vocative) and 
Mahapadmanabha which is an epithet of Visnu and also one of his 24 
aspects (caturviṁ sati-murti, Liebert 1976:204). He is standing

9
on a lotus (padma-sthita).
The very title of the dharani refers to Nilakantha, which is an 
epithet of siva. 
He is invoked as Hara (ehi Hara). His diadem is 
his black matted locks (krsna-jata-mukuta). He is dark blue in 
complexion (krsna-varna). He is the Immutable Lord (ni scareśvara = 
Sthanu or Sthanvisvara, an epithet of Siva). He wears a black 
He is
serpent as ;he sacred thread (krsna-sarpa-krta-yajñopavīta). 
the Destroyer of the three cities (Tripuradahana, an epithet of the 
violent manifestation of Śiva, Liebert 1976:304). He holds the 
dreadful poison (visadhara) that he swallowed on its emergence from 
the churning of the ocean of milk that threatened the world with 
destruction (maha-halahala-visa) and in consequence destroys the 
sinister poisons of passion (rāga), envy (dvesa), and delusion (moha) • 
The mahāṭṭahasya of the dharani refers to the fury of His laughter, 
which is unique to Him. Siddha-yogi svara is again an epithet of 
Siva.

Conclusions
Nflakantha Lokesvara and Potalaka Avalokitesvara are both an 
epiphany of Hari-Hara. In all probability the two are identical.
2. The epithet Alokātikranta 'He who transcends Effulgence' 
supports the hypothesis that Nilakantha is the Lokesvara at Potalaka. 
Potalaka is rendered into Chinese by Buddhabhadra as "Brilliance" 
(aloka).
3.
NTlakantha Lokesvara has the attributes of Siva and at the 
end of the dharani he is lauded as one who holds the four implements 
carried by Visnu in his four hands: sankha, cakra, gada and padma. It 
reminds of the syncretism of Hari-Hara images.
4. The Dalai Lamas, the Rulers of Tibet, are reincarnations of 
the Avalokitesvara who resides on the Potala. The palace of the 
Dalai Lamas at Lhasa is in fact designated Potala. The aspect of 
Avalokitesvara as the Sovereign Head of State, stems from Visnu. A 
King on earth is an incarnation of Viṣṇu.
5. The image at Potalaka symbolised the syncretism of siva and 
Visnu, and in its later development when Buddhism became dominant it 
became Avalokitesvara. An important fact for the convergence of 
Saivism, Vaisnavism and Buddhism. A spot once sanctified remained 
sacrosanct, while externals underwent change.
6. The text of the dharani in Chih-t'ung's version is longer. 
and has crucial details: krsna-sarpa-krta-yajñopavitaya svaña/... 
vana-kandha-desa-sthita-kranajinaya svaka / (STP.6.1302-3). So also 
other versions preserve variations of consequence. A detailed study 
of all the Chinese translations of the dharani alongwith their des- 
criptive text in Chinese giving directions for its use, is essential 
to trace the impregnation of Buddhism by Saiva/Vaisnava elements and 
the emergence of syncretic trends in the Tantras. The dates of the 
Chinese translations can help to define the chronology of philosophi- 
cal development in India.
7. Nilakandi in Amoghavajra's version is an Uigur form, which he 
must have employed by force of habit. This tiny but subtle and 
crucial nuance is decisive in confirming the view that he hailed 
from Samarkand.

A NOTE ON THE GILGIT MANUSCRIPTS
by
LOKESH CHANDRA, New Delhi.
The discovery of Gilgit Manuscripts is a landmark in the history of 
Sanskrit, Buddhist, Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian studies. The events that 
lead to their exhumation have been described in details by Sylvain Lévi in JA. 
tome CCXX, 1932, pp. 13ff., and by Nalinaksha Dutt in Gilgit Manuscripts 
vol. I preface i-iv and 41-42. Inspite of their tremendous importance, no 
checklist has been published so far. A major part of this invaluable collection 
came to the Library of His Highness the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 
which is now deposited in the National Archives of India, New Delhi preserved 
in five big boxes. A fragmentary leaf has been preserved at the St. Xavier's 
College, Bombay (I HQ., vol. XIV, 1938, p. 409). Eleven leaves came into 
the possession of the British Museum, London. Leaves containing the 
Sangharakṣitā-vadāna of the Vinayavastu were with Sylvain Lévi, but they 
cannot be traced. For several years I had been trying to get about 1,500 
leaves of the mss. which were in the possession of Capt. Agah Mohamed Ali Shah, 
M.A., of the Northern Command, Pakistan Signals, Rawalpindi. Due to 
various reasons the attempt to acquire them was not successful. I wrote to 
Prof. Dr. Joh. Nobel (cf. his Udrayana König von Roruka, Wiesbaden, 1950, 
Vorwort, note 1) and also to the British Museum to obtain these unique mss., 
but the plan did not mature. Ultimately I wrote to Prof. G. Tucci who with 
his characteristic zeal put in efforts to secure them, and finally succeeded. Now 
these leaves are on loan from the Pakistan Government with Prof. Tucci in 
Rome for proper scientific preservatory treatment and publication. During my 
visit to Rome in the winter of 1957, Prof. Tucci told me that they contain 
Tantric, Prajñāpāramitā and Vinaya texts besides a life of Buddha. So far 
nothing has been published about it. From an advertisement on the cover of 
the East and West we come to know that Dr. E. Conze is working on the 
Aştādeśasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramita.
In the present note I propose to give a rough list of those portions of the 
Gilgit mss. which are preserved in the National Archives of India and photo- 
graphs or microfilms of which are found in Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira's collection.
In the accompanying list the titles are as tentatively given by a scholar 
when the collection was in the library of H. H. the Maharaja of Jammu and 
Kashmir, when they are supported by a colophon it has been so indicated in the 
case of unpublished works. The numbers of leaves are revised after restoratory

Prof. Nalinaksha Dutt has given a list of the Vinayavastu leaves that

are not traceable now. These leaves have been shown above in brackets. It is 
very likely that the numbers of extant leaves given by Prof. Nalinaksha Dutt 
are not correct (cf. N. P. Chakravarti in Minor Buddhist Texts part I. G. Tucci, 
P. 175).
The different vastus have been published in the Gilgit MSS. as follows: 
1-5 in vol. III.4, 7-10 in vol. II.2, 11-15 in vol. III.3, 16 in vol. III.1, 17 in 
vol. III.4.
In his edition of Pravrajyävastu, Prof. Nalinaksha Dutt has not utilised 
leaves 43-49a of the Gilgit manuscript which were in the British Museum. He 
has utilised leaves 49b 1.3 onwards as they had been published by Sylvain Lévi 
in the JA. CCXX, 1932, pp. 26-36. I am preparing a new critical edition of all 
the extant leaves duly recording the ms-readings, and also indicating the recon- 
structed portions which is not always clear in the edition of Prof. Nalinaksha

different codex or there has been a mistake on the part of the scribe who has 
copied from an original whose leaves were disarranged. Leaves 199-209, 218-19 
and 222-227 certainly belong to a different codex. This is apparent from the 
scheme of the Vinayavastu codex given above where these leaf-numbers belong 
to other vastus. Thus, in the Bhaiṣajyavastu we have two codices, if not three.

NOTES ON CENTRAL ASIAN BUDDHIST ICONOGRAPHY
by
Lokesh Chandra
International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi
The exhibition of the treasures of Central Asian art from the 
West Berlin State Museums held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New 
York has awakened fresh interest in understanding this important phase 
of Buddhist art. Several items call for more precise identification.
1. Śiva
A head from Khocho, dated to the 7th century, evidences Indo- 
Iranian work. It is identified as 'the head of a devata'. It has 
half-open eyes, with a 'dreamy look': this is a yoga posture of 
intense meditation in which the eyes are concentrated on the tip of 
the nose. The shallow incision between the eyebrows represents the 
third eye. The hairdo has the centre parting "while the rest of the 
hair is swept up in tresses that disappear under a lozenge-patterned 
chaplet" (AASR 1982: 158 no. 96). This hairstyle is associated with 
Siva: "the hair parted in the center and then swept up on the sides 
into a topknot is found on other Siva heads" of the eighth century 
from Afghanistan. A marble face from Afghanistan is illustrated in 
Deborah (1982:101 pl. 22). It is remarkably identical with the Khocho 
head, which in all probability represents Siva.
Two painted clay heads from the Cave of the Statues, Kizil 
(AASR 1982: 70-72 nos. 11, 12) are dated to the sixth century and have 
the third eye painted on the forehead. They were made from moulds. 
A great number of stucco moulds have survived and bear Sanskrit names 
of craftsmen on the reverse. Both have been identified as "head of 
a bodhisattva". The crown is similar to the aforesaid Khocho he ad. 
The style, of the crown and the third eye confirm it as a represent- 
ation of Siva.
2. Nilakantha Avalokitesvara
A fragment of a wall-painting was found in the rubble of 
Temple 9 at Bezeklik (lit. "place of paintings"). It has been 
identified as the head of a brahmin "with long strands of hair, 
apparently wind-blown, the thick beard ... This fragment, unlike most 
of the other paintings found at the site, shows the influence of the 
Indian school" (AASR 1982: 147 no. 81). The identification follows

2
Le Coq (1913: pl. 39d). The third eye between the eyebrows raises new 
possibilities. The Be ze klik monastic complexes were situated on high 
cliffs on the right bank of the Sengim River. Winding paths lead to 
the top of the cliff where several hundred temples have been pre- 
served. The se geographic features recall the description of Mount 
Potalaka of Avalokitesvara in Hsüan-tsang (Be al 1884: 2. 233): "To the 
east of the Malaya mountains is Mount Po-ta-lo-kia (Potalaka). The
passes of this mountain are very dangerous; its sides are precipitous, 
and its valleys rugged. On the top of the mountain is a lake; its 
waters are clear as a mirror. From a hollow proceeds a great river 
which encircles the mountain as it flows down twenty times and then 
enters the southern sea. By the side of the lake is a rock-palace of 
the Devas. Here Avalokitesvara in coming and going takes his abode. 
Those who strongly desire to see this Bodhisattva do not regard their 
lives, but, crossing the water (fording the streams), climb the 
mountain, forgetful of its difficulties and dangers; of those who make 
the attempt there are very few who reach the summit. But even of 
those who dwell below the mountain, if they earnestly pray and beg to 
behold the god, sometimes he appears as Tsz'-tsai-t'ien (Isvara-deva), 
sometimes under the form of a yogi (a Pasupata); he addresses them 
with benevolent words and then they obtain their wishes according to 
their desires". The hair of the Bezeklik head are in typical ascetic 
style, he wears the thick ear-rings of a yogin, and has the third eye 
on the forehead like Mahasvara. The trifoliate ornament around the 
ear-rings symbolises the trifoliate leaf of bilva or wood-apple tree, 
Aegle marmelos. This tree is sacred to Sivaits leaves are dedicated 
to Siva and its fruit is the avvakta form of Siva (Liebert 197 6:43). 
The mural seems to, represent the Potala Avalokitesvara.
Avalokitesvara appears as the metamorphosis of siva the great 
yogin in the Nilakantha-sutra. These are eight translations of this 
text into Chinese:

Bhagavaddharma translated the sutra at Khotan, as we are 
informed by the colophon of its Chinese scroll from Tun-huang (Stein 
3793 at the British Library). Thus the Nilakantha Avalokitesvara 
was popular at Khotan in the first half of the seventh century. 
Twelve scrolls have been found at Tun-huang (Giles 1957:105-106) which indicate his vogue at Tun-huang as well.

The version of Chih-香瓜

than the vulgate version of

invokes Nilakantha with additi-

unique in the fury of his laugh- 
ter (attahasa). The Be ze klik 
head "seems agitated, as if 娑婆訶

strengthen the impression of a五十

This posture represents the attahasa, or furious laughter of NIla-
kantha. The Bezeklik head in all like lihood is Nilakantha Avaloki-

3. Vasistha and Arundhati
Fragment of a mural painting from the Second Domed Cave, 
Kumtura has been identified broadly as a brahmin. The painting 
belongs to the early Indian-influenced phase, dated around A. D. 500. 
He has the typical dress of an ascetic and holds a flask (kamandalu) 
in his right hand. Behind him is a devata, to which a rosary of 
beads appears to have been added later (AASR 1982: 80 no. 18). This
seems to be a representation of Vasistha followed by Arundhati. 
Vasistha is the owner of the wish-fulfilling cow Kamadhenu and the 
leader of brahmarşis: as such his attribute is the kamandalu, the 
gourd jar of ascetics with a narrow neck. Arundhati is renowned for 
her faithfulness to her husband Vasistha. She is the inseparable 
consort of the Sage. When a rsi is accompanied by his spouse, they

4
are most likely to be Vasistha and Arundhati. The question arises: 
does the couple occur in Buddhist art? Vasistha and Arundhati are in 
fact depicted in the Sino-Japanese Garbhadhatu mandala. They are 
represented together (Esot. 206, 207) in the external quarter of 
vajras, wherein deities of the Hindu pantheon are shown. They head 
the deities on the East, followed by the Sun (Surya), Ketu, Mithuna, 
Vrsa, Meşa and so on. Arundhati is a personification of the morning 
star, which precedes sunrise, and thus she naturally comes before 
Surya in the mandala, Their Sino-Japanese names are Basu-sen (Vasistha- 
rşi) and Basusen-kō (the consort ko of Vasistha rsi). Vasistha has a 
bloomed lotus in the right hand while his left turns a rosary. Arun- 
dhati holds a leaf and bud of a lotus in her right and a lotus flower 
in the left hand. The Sino-Japanese mandala can be dated to the 
eighth century.

4. Tukhara Melody
A divine musician was painted on the walls of the Prayer-Wheel 
Cave at Kizil, dated around A. D. 600-650 (AASR 1982: 93 10. 29). 
Chinese records mention the introduction of melodies and musical 
instruments from Kucha since 138 B. C. to the eighth century A. D. (Liu 
Mau-tsai 1969: 99-108). Among the instruments from Kucha was the four- 
stringed lute. It can be seen in the hands of Sarasvati in the Sino- 
Japanese Garbhadhātu mandala (Esot. 331). Sujiva, a member of the 
royal house of Kucha, came to China in A. D. 568 and introduced the 
seven keys of Kucha music: sadharita, kaisika, sadja, sadja-grama, 
saḍava, pañcama, vṛṣabha,
Mo-
Chang Ch'ien brought back musical instruments and melodies 
from Kucha to the Chinese capital Ch'ang-an in 138 B. C. "Only the 
name of these melodies has come down to us: it is Mo-ho-tou-le. 
ho is clearly the Chinese transcription of maha (great). As far as 
tou-le is concerned, the last word still remains to be spoken; it is 
perhaps a variant of Tou-k'u-le, or Tochara. The name of this melody

5
suggests an Indian origin. Possibly this originally Indian melody 
was first known at Kucha, where, as we know, Tocharian was spoken in 
later days. It was the center of Indian-influenced music in Central 
Asia, which later spread to China. At that early date Kucha must 
already have been under Indian cultural influence. In China, a son- 
in-law of Emperor Wu-ti (140-87 B. C.) wrote twenty-eight new tunes 
based on the Mo-ho-tou-le melody, which were played as military music" 
(translation of Liu Mau-tsai 1969: 100 in AASR 1982: 93). We do not 
find any Tukhara melody in Sanskrit texts, except Turus ka-Gauḍa rāga 
in Sangita-ratnākara 3, 383, or Turuş ka-Todi raga in Raga-vibodha of 
Somanatha 247. It is a strange coincidence of a historic leap that 
the Rag Tukhari should occur in the Guru Granth of the Sikks (pages 
1107-17). In the Tukhari rag (or chant =Skt. chandas), the first 
piece is the Barah maha twelve months by Guru Nanakdev, the second 
by the fourth Guru Ramdas (p. 1113), and the third and last piece by 
the fifth Guru Arjundev. This affirms that the Chinese transcription 
of the melody Mo-ho-tou-le is indeed Maha-Tukhāra.
5. Dinnaga
The silk-painting of an 'Angry Arhat' was found by the Third 
German Expedition at the lower end of the Cave of Eightyfour Siddhas 
on the foothills near Turfan. It has been dated to the 8-9th century. 
The figure represented is not an 'Angry Arhat' but Dinnaga, the cele- 
brated master of Buddhist logic. He is in a violent mudra of dis put- 
ation, vanquishing the heretics. A similar Tibetan painting can be 
seen in the Prof. RaghuVira Collection at the International Academy 
of Indian Culture. Dinnaga is one of the Six Jewels (Tib. rgyan drug) 
of Mahayana in the Tibetan tradition. The 84 Siddhas as well as the 
Six Jewels are well-established in Tibetan iconography. The fact that 
the painting was recovered from the Cave of 84 Siddhas lends support 
to its identification as that of Dinnaga. If so, it would be the 
earliest representation of Dinnaga in a militant mudra: at Nalanda he 
had defeated Brahmana Sudurjaya (lit. invincible) and other Trtha 
dialecticians. Since he refuted the Tirthikas, he was called a 
'Fighting Bull in Discussion'. "His whole life was passed in giving 
blows and receiving counterblows....Kalidasa, the prince of poets, 
warns in his poem to avoid the 'rugged handi (sthula-hasta) of 
Di gnaga. ...Mallinatha compares him with a 'rock' adri-kalpa)" 
(Vidyabhusana 1920: 273). The Buddhists were conscious of the awe- 
inspiring power of their knowledge. Their belligerent attitude against 
the heretics was expressed in violent terms, for example, in the 
Ratu Boko inscription of A. D. 792/3: "I pay homage to Him who is the 
fire of noble Dharma, who shines forth quashing the prevailing beliefs 
of outstanding heretics, struck oy whose majesty the heretics /strong 
like bulls panic away in fright, who in an instant reduces to ashes 
the numerous 
(Lokesh Chandra attachments to heresy and who burns out all bondages 18
1980: 7).

6. Tiered Stupa with Niches
A free-standing tiered stupa, designated Temple Y, was found 
at Khocho (AASR 1982: 55 fig.II: 3). It rests on a square base, with 
three stepped tiers, topped by a structure now lost. Each tier 
contains niches for statues on four sides. A staircase led to the 
top to conduct services, where the main image must have been installed. 
The main image should have been facing the east, and so also the 
staircase. The three tiers can represent the cosmology of Triloka, 
the three worlds of kamadhātu, rūpadhatu and arupadhātu Matsunaga 
1969:43-56). These three realms are represented on the original lotus 
pedestal of the Great Buddha of the Todai ji Monastery (Paine & Soper 
1955: 23).
It is interesting that similar niched stupa-like structures 
continued to be constructed by kings of Central Asian extraction 
centuries after they had been converted to Islam, when their meaning, 
function and symbolism had ceased to be relevant. In New Delhi, the 
Chor Minar has niches exactly like those of the Temple Y. It rests 
on a square platform, with one tier of niches topped by a tapering 
stele. There are three niches each in the south, west and north, on 
level to them there are two niches"the east, while the third niche 
of the east is on a higher storey, approached by a staircase. This
upraised niche faces the rising sun. The morphology of the structure 
is strongly reminiscent of the Buddhist architecture of Central Asia. 
In its original function the twelve niches could have enshrined the 
Twelve Adityas, in which the upraised first of them in the east could 
have had the main image, consecrated daily by the first rays of the 
Rising Sun. The Sun is the emblem of royalty and the cosmic symbol 
of its stability. The main niche could be reached by stairs, which 
were essential for the daily services of the Image.
Cunningham (1883: 149-150) says of the Chor Minar: "At 8 feet 
there is a belt of moulding all round, above which at regular 
intervals there are nine rows of round holes, about 9 or 10 inches in 
diameter. In each row there are twenty-five holes, so that there 
still remain 225 holes for the reception of as many human heads. 
Three more rows of holes would have raised the number to 300, and the 
height of the tower to 41 feet above the terrace. ...That the tower 
was intended for the reception of human heads, which was further 
confirmed by the discovery of something like human hair still sticking 
to the mortar in one of the holes. When thieves were executed, 
their heads were cut off and stuck into these holes, where they could 
be seen by all the people. The women also pointed to the Kos-Minar 
close to the roadside, and said that all the travellers along the 
road could see the heads".
"I have read the numerous executions of dakaits and robbers 
whose heads were thus exposed, but, as well as I can remember, the 
numbers never exceeded 30 or 40 in a single gang. On the other hand, 
the recorded numbers of heads of prisoners taken in war usually ran 
up to many thousands. ...Similar towers were erected by Firoz Tughlak

7
in Bengal amounting to the incredible number of 180, 000 heads". Babar
won a decisive victory over the Rajput clans in 1527: "As a final 
disgrace a tower of the rajas' severed heads was built on the hill 
and Babur became Ghazi, Avenger in the name of God" (Godden 1980: 40, 
illus. on p. 41).
It seems that during its triumphant march across Buddhist 
Central Asia, Islam stuck the heads of Buddhist monks on the renowned 
and sacrosanct stupas. Due to the height of the stupas, these severed 
heads were visible from long distances and they struck terror in the 
hearts of the vanquished. They became the might of the new order, 
foreboding dread against transgression and preempting reversion. The 
historic Buddhist form survived with new political functions in the 
Islamic period which we witness, inter alia, in the Chor Minar.

NYAI LARA KIDUL: GODDESS OF THE SOUTHERN SEAS
by
Prof. Lokesh Chandra, New Delhi
The mystery of Nyai Lara Kidul has several elements of the 
intricate processes of acculturation and evolution of historical 
events. Incisive insights into the origin and development of her 
mystery are provided by Cambodian history. Ngai Lara Kidul is the 
mind's geometry of the kingdom of Mataram that was founded by Sanjaya, 
descendant of a local prince in about AD 732. The kingdom was so 
named in the tenth century, after it had been divided into many small
principalities in the ninth century. The ancient kingdom, Mataram 
Pertama or Hindu, was reconstituted around 1582-1601 by Sultan 
Senåpati. Sultan Agung (1613-1643) transformed it into an empire with 
himself as Ruler or Susuhunan. There were two states of Surakarta 
and Yogyakarta with separate rulers. Both the states have had the 
cult of Nyai Lara Kidul. Matara is a town on the west coast, eact of 
Galle in Sri Lanka and it gave the name to the town and post of 
island. 
on Lombok The founder of the Mataram Pertama in the Mataram 
eibth century, Sanjaya must have consecrated the wholeness of his 
state with the holiness of this Goddess of the Southern seas alive 
with veins of sacred time.
Nyai Lara Kidul as Goddess of the Southern Seas (Jordaan 1984:99) 
These Indians reminds of South Indian migrations across the Seas. 
must have worshipped a Goddess for a safe and successful journey. In 
Cambodia, the Goddess of the Seas is Mani-mekhala (Lévi 1937: 371-91). 
Mekhala and Kanci both mean a 'waist-girdle'. I venture to suggest 
that Manimekhala must have been worshipped as the city-goddess 
(nagara-devata) of Kanci. The migrants from Kanci and its state could 
have constituted a sizeable proportion, and worshipped Her on the high 
Seas. They must have consecrated landings by extensive rituals of the 
Goddess, un arrival at a sea coast after a long and exhausting voyage. 
They were faced by tribal people, not only inhospitable but hostile. 
As time went by they had to marry local women to adjust to the new 
space, hey gained the respect of the local rulers by a higher 
civilisation. The enterprising among them could vanquish the local 
ruler and marry the queen of the tribe who was later on acculturised 
and divinised as a Nagi. Naga means not only 'a serpent' but also 'the 
best or most excellent of any kind (at the end of a compound), elephant! 
Kaundinya married a nagi, taught her to wear a sarong, and introduced 
cultivation of rice. When established in the New Domains, they must 
The Goddess of the Seas have sanctified their power through Her. 
assumed powers of conferring royal authority and Her rituals continually

strengthened the new state.
We can discern the following elements in the Manimekhala cult: 
1.From a city goddess of Kañci to the Great Goddess.
2.From the Great Goddess in general to the Goddess of the Seas in
particular.
3.Legitimation of political power by marriage with the local queen, 
the autochthone Nagi.
4.Validation of a new state by association with the Goddess as
conferring a hallowed origin that recalls the mytho-historical 
e.g.
ancestors: the brahmana Kaundinya and Nagi as the founders of 
the Funan state.
5.Stabilisation is a prime political issue for any state.This was
effected by continuing sanctification of the kingdom by the 
nightly union of the king with the Goddess as a beautiful woman 
in the Temple of the State.
Nyai Lara Kidul is so to say a Javanese version of Manimekhala 
in her multiple functions as Po Nagar "Goddess of the State" 
Lara Kidul and the foundation of the state of Mataram. In 732,
Sanjaya founded a kingdom in the centre of Java. Though it is not known 
was
for sure what the name of Sanjaya's kingdom, today we refer to it
as bearing the name of Mataram. To distinguish it from Senopati's
kingdom, we call it Mataram Hindu or Mataram Pertama (Pertama = the 
first). During its existence for nearly two hundred years (until the 
year 928), it built many temples, of which the Prambanan is the most 
famous. As nothing is known in the history of Central Java from 928 
to 1500, it cannot be said that the Mataram of Senopati is a continu- 
ation of the Mataram of the old days, the Mataram Hindu/ M. Heesodo's letter). 
The story of Nyai Lara Kidul is connected with Panembahan 
Senapati, the founder of the Mataram dynasty. Senapati's father, Ki 
Ageng Pamanahan, having beaten and killed the governor of Jipan because 
of his recalcitrance, was granted the Mataram lands by the king of 
Pajang. After his father's death, Sutowijoyo (Senopati's youth name) 
stood up against the king. After the king's death in the war (1582), 
Mataram became the new kingdom, replacing Pajang. Sutowijoyo called 
himself Panembahan (= the Reverend) Senopati (= Commander-in-Chief). 
It was his grandson who adopted the title of Sultan (1613), 
and called himself Sultan Agung (the Great Sultan). As the governers 
were not willing to acknowledge Senopati as their new king, Senopati 
had to conquer them one by one. According to folk tales, in his 
conquests Senopati was always aided by the invisible army of Nyai 
Lara Kidul.(letter of M. Hoesodo)
Nyai Lara Kidul is said to be the consort of all Mataram kings. 
After the division of Mataram in 1755, we have the state of Surakarta

3
(reigned by a Sunan) and the state of Yogyakarta (by a sultan). On the
grounds of the krat on palace of Surakarta is a tower where the 
Sunan is said to hold a meeting with the goddess on certain nights of 
the year. At the anniversary of his coronation day the sacred Bedaya- 
dance is always held, performed by nine girls. But at certain moments 
the audience sees ten girls, then people say that one of then is the 
goddess herself.
Once a year, at the Labuhan ceremony (= ceremony of throwing 
offerings into the sea) -on the anniversary of the Sultan's accession 
to the throne ·a delegation of Krat on servants takes offerings to 
the village Parangkusumo at the South Coast. It was here that the 
founder of the kingdom of Mataram, Panembahan Senopati, first met Nyai 
Lara Kidul 400 years ago. His cut hair and clipped fingernails are 
buried at Parangkusumo, and his used clothes are given to the waves 
together with a large amount of various new clothes. At this highly 
official, sacred Krat on ceremony common people can only be spectators. 
They become active after the end of the ceremony. They fish pieces of 
clothes out of the sea, and sell them at high prices.
The close connection of Nyai Lara Kidul with water is a reminder 
of the people beyond the seas who heralded the dawn of a culture and 
rites that ; to inform the state structures of Indonesia for centuries. 
The Borobudur is situated in the village Bumi Samudra, where Indians 
from beyond the Seas had settled. A lead-bronze inscription discovered 
on the west plain of the Borobudur, speaks of Daksinapatha or South 
India. Senapati meets Nyai Lara Kidul on the beach of the southern 
coast. "Not far from there is the underwater palace of Lara Kidul. 
When she was with the Sultan of Yogyakarta, she stayed in a special 
room in the tower of the Water Castle" (ibid. 106). Nyai Lara 
(maiden) Kidul (of the South) carriesin her name itself
memories of South [India].
1. The Javanese regard Nyai Lara Kidual as the Goddess of the Souther 
Seas, i.e. the Indian Ocean off the southern coast of Java.
2. She is the king-maker, as she tells Senapati the founder of the 
kingdom of Mataram that he and his descendants will rule Java.
3. The Babad Tanah Javi records that Sultan Agung, a descendant of 
Senapati, took her as his bride and often stayed with her in her 
underwater palace off the southern coast. The nightly rendezvous of 
the king with the Nyai Lara Kidul in a palace-tower reminds of the 
rati-pūjā rites in the innermost sanctum of the kuṭāgāra or palace- 
tower.
4. The superseding kingdoms of Surakarta and Yogyakarta maintain 
their alliance with her. The present Sultan of Yogyakarta has 
contacts with her.

5.The various elements of Nyai Lara Kidul as a fertility goddess,
and her relationship with the rice-goddess Devà Sri are her extended 
functions as the Goddess of the State.
Legitimation of power. The association of the snake cult with 
Nyai Lara Kidul is a later accretion due to the semantics of the word 
nagi. Nyai Lara Kidul as a serpent deity is a nagi. Nāgì is a 
euphemism for a chthonian woman. Kaundinya had married the local 
queen, the nagi queen, to validate his political authority. The 
Kaunḍinya complex is the fundamental pattern the theory and practice 
of state in SE Asia. It is the social-political response to emerging 
ethno-cultural projections wherein the existing context and the new 
order find a harmonisation. The state is sanctified by Nyai Lara 
Kidul of the Javanese, Po Nagar of the Chams, Maņimekhala of the 
Khmers, and the Rati-goddesses in the innermost sanctum of the 
Vajradhatu-mandala in the kūṭāgāra the tower-palace.
"She is said to reside in an underwater palace. Members of 
the Kratons in Yogyakarta and Surakarta refer to her as Kanjeng Ratu 
Kidul 
•According to them she has two female patih (chief ministers), 
Nyai Lara (or Rara) Kidul, and Nyai Riya Kidul. (Many people prefer 
to spell Loro, Roro and Riyo instead of Lara, Rara and Riya). The 
common people, however, know only one figure, Nyai Lara (or Loro) 
Kidul. She rules over a kingdom that is structured like the Central 
Javanesethe 
Kingdom of Mataram. With help of her spirit-army she protects L
Mataram and all the Sultans, who are regarded as her human spouses. 
The range of her power is said to be far: she can be malevolent, 
sending storms, inundations, plagues and epidemics; but she can be 
beneficient as well, protecting and fulfilling wishes, when asked for 
with the proper rituals. (M. Hoesodo).
The 'vacillating character' attributed by Hidding is not 
correct. As an omnipotent Supreme Goddess all emanates from her: 
both good and evil. It is she who gives the kingdom to Javanese 
rulers, protects them, and even deserts them when they go wrong. 
Her negative endowments strengthen her positive powers. They become 
punitive deterrants.
Stabilisation of power. "Lara Kidul is an ever-rejuvenating 
bride, who enters into marriage with successive Javanese rulers" 
(Jordaan 1984:104). The yellow colour of her skin (lara kunin) may 
also be explained by the customary practice of greasing the body 
with yellow powder on ceremonial occasions" (ibid. 105). 
In India 
a bride-to-be is massaged with turmeric to give her body a yellow 
complexion. Yellowing in fact means the ceremonies preliminary to 
marriage and by semantic extension it refers to marriage. The

5
devadasis are known as nityasumangali 'eternal brides'.
Jordaan (1984:113 n.8) states: "As far as Southeast Asia is 
concerned, we may point out the parallel between the stay of Lara 
Kidul at the water Castle, and the nightly unions of Khmer kings in 
the Phimeanakas (a tower-shaped building of the Angkor Thom complex) 
with a 'serpent goddess' who appeared under the guise of a beautiful 
woman".
"Cambodian legends and legendary genealogies agree in having 
their kings descend from the union of a fabled ancestor (an Indian, of 
course, as the brahmans were from India) with a nagi, daughter of the 
Nagaraja, owner of the soil. As late as the end of the thirteenth 
century, a Chinese visitor to Cambodia relates that every night the 
King of Cambodia went high up into the tower of the royal temple of 
the Phimeanakas at Angkor, to spend the first watch with the naga 
princess, daughter of the Nāgarāja, and that on this union depended 
the welfare, even the existence, of the Kingdom" (Briggs 1951:14). 
Kaundinya became king of Funan in the fifth century, married Soma the 
nagi of the Lunar dynasty (Briggs 1951:24). The Phimean-akas = Vimana 
Akasa 'Celestial Palace' is a pyramid standing in the heart of the 
royal palace. On its cruciform foundation, in the centre of the upper 
platform there was a sanctuary built of light material covered with 
gold, for the Chinese pilgrim Ch'ou Ta-kuan saw it and called it the 
'Tower of Gold' (Frédéric 1965:288 pl.319).
The Phimean-akas is clearly a great stone pyramid, called 
temple-mountain by European scholar It is the Sumeru in a tantric 
mandala, which is topped by a kūṭāgāra. Its kūṭāgāra or tower must 
have been a gilded wooden construction, as Ch'ou describes it. Inside 
the tower was the sanctum with all the deities. A gilt bronze image 
of Hevajra was found in the ruins of the royal palace of Jayavarman 
VII (1181-1220?) from Angkor Thom. Gilding of a statue is done for 
conseccration. The gilded statue of Hevajra indicates that tantric 
practices were prevalent in Cambodia.
In the innermost shrine, in the sanctum sanctorum of a tantric 
mandala, were located four goddesses in the corners. In the Vajradhātu- 
mandala the four goddesses are in the very centre of the kūṭāgāra: 
Lasya (SE), Mala (SW), Gita (NW) and Nrtya (NE) (NSP. text 45-46). 
The deities clearly indicate the goddess in the form of a young beauty 
offering the garland as Mālā, singing as Gita, dancing as Nrtya: all 
to induce tumescence and frenzy, and finally the ritual orgy with its 
indulgence or licence. "Dancing, revelry and amorous propensities 
were not only religious exaltation but a means of acquiring supernatural 
energy for the working of vegetation-magic" (ERE.9.,558)

6
These four goddesses are the inner puja-deities because they 
are in the intimacy of the corners of the innermost sanctum. They 
are found in three more mandalas in the Nispannal yogavali: 
Mandala of Dharmadhatu-vagisvara Majughosa, who is the acme of
srngara-rasa-rasi (NSF text p.58).
Mandala of Mahavairocana of Durgati-parisodhana (NSP text p.66). 
Mandala of Ratnaḍāka among the Panca-daka (NSP text p.76).
Two other mandalas have variations of these four goddesses: 
Mandala of Vajradhara according to the Samputa-tantra: Hasya (E), 
Lasya (S), Gita (w), Nrtya (N) (NSP text p.10). 
Mandala of Yogambara: Lasya, viņa, Gita, Nrtya (NSP text p.33).
The Pao-hsiang Lou Pantheon (Clark 1937:2.145 no. 4B55) has a 
statuette of Lasya where her hands hold two vajras which have a 
phallic form.
In the four mandalas of the first abhisamaya of the Tattva- 
sangraha she is rati-pūjā, kāma-rati-pūjā, jñāna-rati, rati-rată, 
lāsya-rati-pūjā. Rati means plesure of love, sexual passion of union, 
amorous enjoyment (often personified as one of the two wives of 
Kāmadeva, together with Priti). These tantric rituals provide a 
precedent to the Cambodian practice in the Phimean-akas.
1.1.26 Vajralasya arises out of the samadhi of Vairocana that 
emanates from the symbolism of the rati-puja of all Tathāgatas. She 
says that no worship equals mine for all types of worship is intiated 
by kama-rati-pūja.
I.2.26 In the vajraguhya-vajra-manḍala, her dharani is: Om 
vajraguhya-ratipūjā-samaye sarva-pujam pravartaya svaha (STTs. p.35). 
I.3.26 In the vajra-jñāna-dharani-mandala, she is named 
Sarva-tathāgata-jñāna-rati and her dharani is: Om jñāna-lāsye 
(Gobushingan 246 no.97).
I.4.26 In the vajrakarya-karma-mandala, her name is Sarva- 
tathāgata-rati-rată, and her dharani is: Om sarva-tathāgata-lāsya-rati- 
pūjā-megha-samudraāspharaṇa-samaye hum (Gobushingan 304 no. 126).
Her connection with skin disease reminds of the devadasi cult, 
who came primarily from the lower strata of society. The Devadasi is 
known as jogin (Skt. yogini) in Andhra Pradesh, jogti in Rajasthan, 
Matangi in Kerala. The word matangi indicates that they came mostly 
from the sudra caste. In the Belgaon district of Karnataka they are 
sudra girls. The landlord of the village who spends the first night 
with her, commands special respect. When the marriage of the son or 
daughter is negotiated, it is a matter of status to relate the number 
of devadasis kept.

Nyai Lara Kidul creates and sustains the kingdom.She assures
the prosperity of the realm as the rice goddess, with the addition of
new attributes and functions derived from chthonian deities.

CEREMONY FOR NYAI LORO KIDUL
Ever heard of the ruler of the Indian Ocean? She is Nyai Loro 
Kidul, queen of all water-nymphs, who is fanatically fond of the green 
colour. For the people of Java, especially who live on the southern 
coastal area, Nyai Loro Kidul is a mysterious legendary figure. At
Pelabuhan-ratu Beach Hotel, Sukabumi (in West Java), for instance, a 
special room is dedicated to her, and never rented out. It is said 
that on certain nights the room spreads a fragrant smell.
There is another story about the people along the coast of the 
Special Territory of Yogyakarta. For them the Ocean is the realm of 
Queen Nyai Loro Kidul, the beach is the demarcation line which has to 
be respected. It is a sacred line for them. It is so sacred that 
they taboo everything that is green-coloured on the beach, because it 
is the favourite colour of the Sea Goddess.
There are rumours about the probibition of wearing green clothes 
on the beach. Being rumours, they are difficult to believe. 
Once a
visitor was mysteriously lost when he was strolling along the coast, 
because he wore a green coat. Just by wearing a green cap, one has the 
chance of being summoned by the queen to appear in front of her at the 
palace. Having been summoned, he had to reach as soon as possible, he 
walked and walked to the centre of the ocean, and did not return. He 
is called kalap, which means 'taken away or summoned'.
to be
But if he is not wearing a green coat, then he is said dikersak- 
ake, which means she wanted him. People say that lost persons are made 
subjects of the Sea Goddess. Whatever the cause of his death, that 
was his fate, which is interpreted by people as power of Nyai Loro 
Kidul. Anyhow, at last it is decided that people have to offer food 
(caos to offer' dahar 'food'), by burning incense, in order to evade 
disaster in the South Sea.
On the coast of Parangtritis south of Yogyakarta, it is a custom 
that one can let somebody else do the food offering by giving a trifle 
for his services. This belief spreads from the coast to the centre 
of the city along the Chode River, which splits the city in two halves. 
Every year on a certain day, people who live along the river 
prepare a welcoming ceremony for Nyai Loro Kidul who is said to visit 
Mount Merapi by travelling along the river together with her escorts. 
They are afraid if they do not bid her welcome, then she will spread 
an epidemic among them. As the exact time of her visit is not known, 
people are vigilant for several nights, for the supposed D-Day. 
Having waited long, all at once, they hear thundering sounds 
from the South, approaching the mountain. The sounds come nearer and 
and
nearer, everyone is frightened. If the sounds are heard very closely,

A

th
everyone beats everying that gives a loud sound. They are winnows, 
tom-toms, rice-blocks etc Which have been prepared for this purpose, 
while shouting Lampor lampor... People believe that at that 
moment the goddess and her army pass by along the river. The tumult 
lasts 15 to 20 minutes, and it stops if the thundering sounds are 
heard far in the North. The people are calm again as before.
At Gombong (approximately 150 km west of Yogyakarta) the welcom- 
ing of Nyai Loro Kidul is called Tundan, which means it is their turn 
to welcome her. (Written by M. Harjo in Kartini July 1985, 
the ladies' magazine issued from Jakarta, Translated from the Indonesian
language by M. Hoe sodo).

PRELUDE
Oddiyana played a pivotal role in the development, 
redaction and dissemination of the Tantras. It was the centre 
whence the Tantras originated. According to Bu-ston it was at 
Oddiyana that Vajrapani collected "endless revelations of 
Vajrayāna", and gave them to Indrabhuti. Guhyasamaja, the 
culmination of Tantric thought, was also revealed to Indrabhūti 
in Oddiyana. The Tattva-prabhasa-karanda-dipa (Toh.2643) and 
Jnana-tilaka-yogini-tantra-raja (Toh.422) of the Guhyasamāja 
tradition point out that Indrabhuti was an incarnation of 
Vajrapani, and it was he who knew and could explain the 
Guhyasamaja. The Guhyasamaja was commented upon by Candrakirti. 
who was a follower of the tantric Nagarjuna who was born at Kanci 
and whom the texts call Kancannara (sic, Tucci 1949:1.214). The 
explicit reference to Kanci holds the key to the identification 
of Oddiyana. It is significant that Indrabhuti was an incarna- 
tion of Vajrapani, who was the presiding deity of Mangakoṣṭha 
situated in Oddiyana, or modern Ekamresvara at Kanci.
It was from Oddiyana that Padmasambhava went to Tibet and 
firmly laid the foundations of Vajrayana in the Land of Snows. 
Hence the present multidimensional approach to a fresh 
consideration of the geographic location of Oddiyana, the heart- 
land of Vajrayāna.

ODDI YANA: A NEW INTERPRETATION
Introductory
1.1 The identification of Oddiyana has been clouded by the 
'fact that it was sought to be equated with the Sanskrit toponyms 
Udyana and Udra. The phonology of the term Oddiyana is so clear 
that it cannot be mixed up with Udyana. The identification of 
Oddiyana with Udyana/Ujjanaka in the Northwest of India was 
enunciated in a period of the euphoria of discoveries of 
Buddhist antiquities from Gandhara and other Northwestern 
regions of India which seemed to be the prime locus of Buddhism. 
At that time, it was but natural that Udyana came foremost to 
the minds of Buddhologists as the place to be equated with 
Oddiyana, inspite of the difficulties posed by phonological
considerations.
1.2 The Chinese characters for Udyana in Hsuan-tsang are 
Wu-chang-na (Watters 1905:1.225) and represent the Mid- 
Indic form Ujjana. The character chang cannot be forced to 
yield ḍ. The cerebral d is transliterated by by Hsüan-tsang, 
who follows a consistent system for the transliteration of 
Sanskrit.
1.3 When Oddiyana was identified with Udyana, South India 
had not come to occupy a place of relevance in the evolution of 
Buddhism, and as such how could it strike any investigator that 
Oddiyana could have a South Indian derivation.It was beyond
speculation that it could be a Tamil word. As it will be clear 
in sequence, oddiyana in Tamil means 'girdle' like its Sanskrit 
counterpart kanci. In fact, Oddiyana is Kanci. Kanci was one of 
the seven great cultural metropolis' of India and the glorious 
capital of the Pallavas, who played a major role in the diffusion 
of Vajrayana to lands beyond the seas. The South Indian places 
of Sriparvata, Dhanyakaṭaka, Potalaka and Oddiyana were some of 
the foremost creative centres of Mantrayana, especially, of 
systems centring around Vairocana, namely the (1) Avatamsaka

2
sutras (ii) carya tantras, and (iii) yoga tantras--in all the 
three the Cosmic Buddha was Vairocana with varying iconographic 
attributes. It is not surprising that the land par excellence 
of Vajrayana in the Tibetan tradition, should be Oddiyana = 
Kanci.
2. Forms of the word Oddi yana
2.1 The toponym Oddiyana occurs in the following eleven 
forms in Sanskrit and Tibetan texts:
(1) Uddiyana-vinirgata-Kurukulla occurs in sadhana 179 of the 
Sadhana-mala, where the variant reading is Odiyana. She is 
equivalent to Hevajra-Kurukulla, Hevajra-tantra-krameņa 
Kurukulla (Ni spannayogaval1 6, HT 1.11.13, SM 179, 183, 186, 
187--cited in Mallmann 1975:228).
(ii) Uddiyanaka appears in the MahamayurT 97 (Lévi 1915:56, 
105f.) as the place of residence of yaksa Karala.
(iii) The spelling U-dyan can be seen in two titles of the 
Tanjur dedicated to Oddiyana-Marīci and both translated by Don- 
yod-rdo-rje and Ba-ri lotsava:
Toh. 3344 U-dyan-gyi hod-zer-can-gyi sgrub-pahi-thabs : 
Uddiyana-Mari ci-sadhana. Author: Lhan-cig-skyes-pahi-rol-pa. 
Toh. 3345 U-dyan-gyi rim-pahi hod-zer-can-gyi sgrub-paḥi-thabs = 
Oddiyana-krama-mari ci-sadhana.
(iv) Odiyana is prefaced to Marici: Odiyana-Mari ci 
(SM.138/1.283-47, 139). In SM 140 Odiyana-pitha has the 
variant reading Oddiyana-pTtha in the manuscript of the 
Cambridge University Library dated N.S.285-A.D.1165. Odiyana- 
MaricT is also termed Vajradhātvi svart Marici (SM.136, Mallmann 
1975:261). The replacement of Odiyana by Vajradhātu may 
enshrine the secret of its identification with Kanci. It was

3
from Kanci that the Vajrasekhara-tantra and its Vajradhātu- 
mandala was transmitted to China. Odiyana was the vajrapī tha. 
we find Odiyana-vajrapitha Vajravarahi in SM.225 (1.439): śrī- 
oḍiyana-vajrapitha-vini rgata urdhvapada-vajravarahl-sadhanam 
samăptam, colophon. Here the Nepalese manuscript of N.S.285 = 
A.D.1165 kept at the Cambridge University Library has the 
reading Odyana.
The form 0-di-ya-na occurs in the Blue Annals 2.753, as well 
as in three titles of the Tanjur which were translated by Grags- 
pa-rgyal-mtshan:
Toh. 3528, 3529 0-di-ya-nahi hod-zer-can-gyi sgrub-thabs : 
Oddiyana-marici-sadhana (ms. Odi°).
Toh. 3566 0-di-ya-na-las byun-bahi rigs-byed-mahi sgrub-thabs : 
Oddiyana-vini rgata-kurukulle-sadhana (ms. Oḍi°).
It may be noted that while Ba-ri lotsva (A.D. 1038-1109 ?) 
used the form U-dyan, Grags-pa-rgyal-mt shan (A.D. 1147-1216) 
employed O-di-yā-na.
(v) We find O-di-yan in the Tanjur title (Toh.3370): 0-di-yān- 
nas byun-baḥi rigs-byed-maḥi sgrub-pahi-thabs 330Oddiyāna- 
vini rgata-kurukulle-sadhana, translated by Don-yod-rdo-rje and 
Ba-ri lotsava.
(vi) Odiyǎnaka appears in a Mathura inscription dated Sah 77 
4
(Lüders, Liste, no.62) commemorating the donation of a pillar to 
a vihara of king Huviska by the monk 'JIvaka Odiyanaka' 
(Lévi 1915:105, Naudou 1968:36).
(vii) Oddiyana is by the most common form. It occurs in the 
colophon of SM.35 (1.80) sarahapada-kṛtam oddiyana (v.1.0d yana) 
kramenņa trailokya vaśamkara 
-lokesvara-sadhanam samaptam. The
colophon in the next sadhana 36 (1.83) reads : iti sarahapādāva- 
tāri ta-oddiyana-vini rgata-trailokya vasankara-lokesvara-sadhanam 
samaptam (Mallmann 1975:108). In a Nepalese manuscript of the

ninth century Vajrapani of Mangakostha in Oddiyana is mentioned
(Foucher 1900:121, Naudou 1968:36). Mang akoṣṭha is an earlier 
name of Ekamresvara temple near the Kamākṣi temple at Kanci : 
Tamil mankay man 'mango-tree' + kay 'fruit', heard and recorded 
by the Portuguese as manga> English mango. The ancient name of 
the site where the present Ekamreśvara temple stands, must have 
been intentionally changed to signal its new religious associa- 
tions. The word Mangakostha may also conceal a double entendre 
to an emanation of goddess Tara, for Tamil mankai means 'a girl 
between 12 and 13 years', Malayalam maňka 'a young, playful 
woman'. Tără was the presiding deity (p1 thi svart) of holy 
Oddiyana, and today her apotheosis is significantly KāmākṣT 'one 
of a morous eyes'. In the Hevajratantra 1.7.12 Oddiyana is 
specified as a pitha. Here the Tibetan text renders Oddiyana by 
U-di which stems from the reading Udiyāna.
(viii) 0-dyan is the form in the Tanjur title (Toh.3340): 
0-dyan-gyi hod-zer-can-gyi sgrub-pahi-thabs Odiyana-mart cyai 
sadhana (so in the xyl.), translated by Don-yod-rdo-rje and Ba- 
ri lotsava. The toponym Odyānam is found in the Malayalam 
Lexicon 2.1246.
(ix) Au-dyan-nas byun-bahi hod-zer-can-gyi sgrub-thabs = 
Oddiyana-marici-sadhana (Toh.3231) provides a variation of 
previous form.
the
(x) U-rgyan, also Odiyana, often written in the abbreviated 
form Jäschke 606b. George N. Roerich consistently adopts 
the spelling U-rgyan in his translation of the Blue Annals 
(index p.1264). In the Tanjur, the following titles have the 
spelling U-rgyan :
Toh. 1707 Dpal u-rgyan-gyi sgrol-mahi mion-par-rtogs-pahi rim-pa: 
śri- -Uddiyana-tara-'bhi samaya-krama (ms. Uḍiyana). Trans. 
SanghaerTbhadra, Hjam-dpal-sgeg-pahi-rdo-rje. In the Blue Annals

5
the title is shortened to Jo-mo U-rgyan-ma.
Toh. 1708 U-rgyan-gyi sgrol-maḥi rim-pa: Uddiyana-tara-krama. 
Transl. as above in 1707.
Toh. 1711 U-rgyan-gyi rim-paḥi sgrol-mahi sgrub-thabs : Uddiyana- 
krama-tara-devi-sadhana. Transl. Parahita, śes-rab-rgyal-mt shan.
Toh. 1744 Dpal u-rgyan-gyi rnal-hbyor daň rnal-hbyor-mahi ran- 
byun-gi lons-spyod dur-khrod-kyi rtog-pa: Uddiyana-sri-yoga- 
yogini-svabhuta-sambhoga-śmaśana-kalpa.Author: Virüpa, transl.
Prajñāśr1jñānakīrti.
(xi) The abbreviated form of the namein Tibetan is an indi- 
cation that once the most common spelling was 0-rgyan. The 
iconographic xylograph Rin-lhan, the socalled Five Hundred Gods 
of Narthang, illustrates the 0-rgyan sgrol-ma gnas-kyi-dbah- 
phyug-ma = Pithivari Oddiyana Tara on folio 45b... In the Padma- 
than-yig O-rgyan is used (Jäschke p.607a). Oddiyana was the 
pitha of Tara. This is reflected in the popular belief that the 
Kāmākṣi temple was originally dedicated to the Buddhist goddess 
Tara later converted into that of a Hindu goddess at the time of 
Sankaracarya's establishment of Kamakoti pitha in the ninth 
century A.D. (Ramachandran 1954:10, Champaklakshmi 1978:116). It 
is significant that from among the four pithas of Oddiyana, 
Pūrṇagiri, Kāmarupa and śrihaṭṭa mentioned in sadhana 234 of the 
Sadhanamala (2.455), there was Kamakhya in Kamarupa and Kamāksl 
at Kanci (Oddiyana), both of them goddesses. In the Hindu 
tantric tradition too the four are sakta pithas devoted to the 
cult of the goddess Sakti.
2.2 Thus we have the following variants from Indian and 
Tibetan sources:
(a) Uddiyana, Uddi yanaka, Udyan, Udi
(b) U-rgyan
(c) Odiyana, Odiyan, Odiyanaka, Oddiyana, Odyan, Audyan

6
(a)0-rgyan
The variations are in the initial vowel uo, single or 
double dd, (a)diy or dy (with the elision of i), dropping of the 
final in Udyan/Odyan/Audyan, addition of the pleonastic ka in 
a 
Uddiyanaka and Odiyanaka.
2.3 The Tibetan terms U-rgyan and O-rgyan represent a 
transliteration of the initial syllable u~o of Uddiyana or 
Oddiyana and rgyan means 'an ornament'. The word U-rgyan 0- 
rgyan signifies 'the ornament termed Uddiyana] or oddiyana7'. 
Thus in the Tibetan term U-(0-)rgyan, u-(o-) is the phonetic and 
rgyan is the semanteme.
2.4In fact in Tamil and other South Indian languages 
oddiyanam means a "gold or silver girdle or belt, an ornament 
worn by women round the waist" (Tamil Lexi con, Madras 1936, 
1.585b). The Lexicon also gives the meaning "girdle worn by 
yogis while in 
asitting posture, so as to bind the waist and 
the doubled up legs together", and translates it in Tamil as 
yogappaṭṭai. The Lexicon gives variant forms in Telegu oddanamu, 
Kannada oddyāna, Tulu odyāna.
2.5 Burrow and Emeneau (1961:71 no.810) give the following 
morphological variations of the lexeme in different South Indian 
languages: "810 Ta. Ottiyanam gold or silver girdle or belt worn 
by women. Ma. utaññan gold chain round the loins. Ka. odyāna, 
oddyāna, oddana, oddavana, oddivana, odvāna belt of gold or 
silver chiefly worn by women. Tu. odyane, odyana belt or girdle 
made of gold and generally worn by a devil-dancer. Te. Oddanamu 
belt of gold or silver worn by women".
2.6 
All the morphological variations noted above from 
Indian and Tibetan sources, can be traced back to South Indian 
languages, thus proving that Oddiyana is the Tamil equivalent of 
Kanci, both meaning 'a girdle'. V.A. Devasenapathi (1975:3)says: 
"The meaning of the word Kanci in Sanskrit is Oddiyanam (a belt 
worn as an ornament around the waist by women). This ornament

7
is worn only around the navel. Kanci is so-called because it is 
the naval position for the earth. Kāñcī māhatmya 31.70 and
Kāmākṣi-vilasa speak of Kanci as the navel of the world:
(1) adhibhautikam amhoghnam nabhisthanam bhuvah param (Kamakṣi- 
vilāsam 11.6), (ii) jagad-kāma-kalākāraṁ nābhisthānam bhuvaḥ 
param (ibid.13.73).Sivajñana Munivar in his Kanci purana refers
to Kanci as the navel-region of the Goddess Earth who wears the 
sea as Her Garment and who shines as the Supreme ākāśa.
3. South Indian words in dharanis
3.1 The presence of Dravida expressions in the dharaṇīs 
is explicitly pointed out by several Buddhist texts (Bernhard 
1967:148-168), some of which were translated into Chinese as 
early as A.D.265-316 (T.310), A.D.383 (T.1547), and A.D.398-399 
(T.212). In the three Chinese translations of the Abhidharma- 
vibhāṣā (T.1547, tr. A.D. 383; T.1546, tr. A.D. 437-439; T.1545, 
tr. Hsüan-tsang A.D.656-659) it is stated that Lord Buddha 
preached the Noble Truths (arya-satyani) to the lokapāla 
Vi rūpākṣa in the language of the South Indian borderlands, as he 
did not understand Sanskrit. The Northern Liang version (T.1546) 
employs the words: in the Dravida language. In the Vinaya of 
the Mula-sarvästi vadins, the Buddha preaches in the 'language of 
the borderlands' (Tib. mthah-ḥkhob-pahi tshig). In the 
Udanavarga it is the Damiḍa language (ib.154). In the Mahāmāyūrī 
Vidyarajni (ed. S. Oldenburg, p.250f.) it is stated: sidhyantu 
dramida mantrapadah svaha (ibid. p.162). Bernhard's in-depth 
study of a single South Indian expression Ine mine dapphe 
dadapphe employed by Lord Buddha to explain the Truths to
Vi rūpākṣa, clearly manifests the urgent need of a comprehensive 
study of the language of dharanis, their South Indian vocabulary, 
the patterns of assonance developed in them to explain the 
jingling concatenation of words, the role of South India in the 
development of tantras, and other related problems. The dharanis

8
cannot be brushed aside as meaningless, for they conceal in their 
intentional camouflage frozen levels of cultural modulations in 
various geographic locales going back deep into two millenia or 
more. Such a study will reveal the beginnings of hidden arche- 
types which later on developed into the complex philosophical 
systems of the tantras, and the diverse streams that converged 
unto them.
3.2Virupakṣa is the lokapala who guards the west and 
understands the Dramida language. Thus the west here refers to 
the Dramida land, and not the 'west of India' (Joshi 1967:329). 
This fact is very important for the interpretation of a crucial 
passage in the Blue Annals 2.753 which has often been misinter- 
preted. In this context 'the west' with reference to Odiyan is 
clear proof that it was located in the Tamil area: "After that a 
from the west Sri Kambala and others discovered the yogini-tantras 
in the country of 0-di-yan. They also spread towards Madhyadesa".
The directions mentioned in Buddhist texts pose a complex problem 
which has to be sorted out. It is significant that the Mañjuśrl- 
müla-kalpa, which was discovered from the Manalikkara matha near 
Padmanabhapuram in South India, "refers to Vidisa (modern Bhelsa, 
M. P.) as being situated 'between west and north' (paści mottarayor 
madhyam). Rahula Samkrtyayana (Puratattva-nibandhavall p.108) 
rightly suggested that the author wrote this from a place in 
south, probably from Dhanyakaṭaka" (Joshi 1967:325). The great 
Tibetan historian, Bu-ston speaks of the "southern country of 
Saurastra" (Obermiller 1932:2.161). The starting point of 
geographic reference has to be sought for. Tucci (1949:2.736) 
says: "But from this passage no definite conclusion can be drawn. 
Uddiyana being in the legend of Padmasambhava a great kingdom, 
it is imagined to extend to the extreme ends of India. In chapter 
XI, that same text Padma-thang-yi g7 locates Za hor to the South- 
east of Bodhgaya while Kamarupa (Assam) is placed to the North- 
East, in this case Za hor would roughly correspond to Orissa. But 
this division of India has no great geographical value: India is

9
for this text a mandala whose center is Bodhgaya; it is a kind of 
miraculous lotus, four leaves corresponding to the four cardinal 
points (Uddiyana 30West, Bengal = East, Kashmir 
=North, Baiddha = 
Vaideha = South) and four other leaves to the intermediate points"
3.3 The presence of South Indian words in dharanis, which 
were precursors of Mantrayana, is borne out by the Karuna- 
pundarika-sutra which speaks of Dramida-mantra-pada (39:1,3) and 
by the Sarvajñatakara-dharani: iyam Dravida-mantra-pada sarvajñata- 
kara-dharani (16.1), and Dravida-mantra-padah (19.8, Mantri 1977: 
88-89). In the Saddharma-pundarika-sutra chap.21 (ed. Kern/Nanjio 
1912:401) rakṣasis expound the dharani iti me5/nime5/ The ...... 
first expressionis conjoined as itime by Watanabe (1975:158, 284) 
and also by Mantri (1977:88) who says: "In the text the words 
'iti' and 'me' are separated, but taking into consideration the 
whole structure of the Dharani-mantras, I would like to suggest 
that two words should be connected and read as 'itime'. It may 
then mean 19'0 Itima'. This can be conjectured from the Dharaṇī 
that follows - 'Nime, nime, nime, nime, nime', which means 
10 Nima'".
3.4 The above dharani can be explained in the general back- 
ground of the world-view of the siddhas. In song number 10 of the 
Caryagitikoṣa "Kanhu says: 'Oh DombT, you live outside the city; 
but how is it that you have now dared to touch the son of a 
brahmana? But, Oh Dombi, I will live with you because I am only 
a naked yogin, who uses the skull (for drinking) and is hated by 
all. The lotus is one but it has 64 petals and the Dombi is now 
dancing on it. She is now eating the lotus stalk in the lake. I 
shall now get hold of her and reach the other shore'" (Sastri 
1977:687).
3.5 Furthermore, the interpretation of the dharaṇī cited 
above is possible as a Tamil expression. In Tamil i is a 
demonstrative base expressing the nearer or proximate person or 
thing; prefaced to nouns, expressing nearness (Burrow/Emeneau

10
1961:30 no.351a). It is i before a consonant and ivv before a 
vowel. The second word timi-timi is explained by Burrow and 
Emeneau (1961:209, no.2644) as 'syllables sung to keep time in 
dancing', Kannada dimi 'sound produced by the quick motion of 
the feet in dancing', Tulu dimidimi 'dancing nimbly, agility'. 
In the Lankavatara-sutra (ed. Nanjio 1956:260) we find the 
spelling dime-dime. i time refers to the nible dancer who is 
The third word nime-nime is a 
near the heart of the yogin. 
jingling assonance of time-time. The variation ten reflects
the sound sequence of the Tamil alphabet. In the Lankavatāra 
there is another assonance dime-dime hime-hime, which echoes the 
sequence of t/d and ph, that is, the dentals are followed by 
the labials. Regarding the ph phenomenon, Caldwell (1961:147) 
says: "Tamil and Malayalam are destitute of the sound of h..... 
a substitute for P, In Modern Canarese h is regularly used as 
in sometimes the case in Marathi; but ancient Canarese agrees as 
in this particular with Tamil". Thus the jingling sequence of 
2
dime hime is afeature that could have arisen only in the
Tamil-speaking area.
3.6Traces of Tamil words underlie cryptic expressions in 
the tantras, which await research. The anuttara-yoga tantras 
are classified (Wayman 1973:235) into (i) neither father nor 
mother tantras, (ii) mother tantras, and (iii) father tantras. 
The second 
The mother tantras are divided into seven groupings. 
group of Heruka (i.e. Akşobhya) is subdivided into five classes. 
The fifth class pertains to Arali which has two texts: Vajra- 
Arali-mahatantra-raja (Toh.426) and Rigi-Arali-tantra-rāja 
(Toh.427), both translated by Kayasthapagayadhara and Sakya-ye- 
ses. A sadhana to Rigi-Arali in the Tanjur was translated by 
Rin-chen-grub: Rigi-Arali-sadhana (Toh.1658). Rigi corresponds 
to Telugu rēku 'petal', Kolami (w) rekka 'leaf' (Burrow/Emeneau 
1961: no.4245). Tamil arali, alari 'oleander, Nerium odorum', 
Malayalam arali 'Nerium; Plumeria acuminata' (Burrow/Emeneau 
1961: no.174).Tamil ari is 'beauty', arival 'woman between the

11
age of 20 and 25, woman, lady', Malayalam aruva 'fine woman' 
(Burrow/Emeneau 1961: no,180), Tamil ari 'fermented liquor, 
toddy' (Burrow/Emeneau 1961: no.182). Thus Rigi-arali means the 
petals of the Nerium odorum, alluding to the 64 petals of the 
lotus on which the Dombi dances. The word arali veils an allu- 
sion to ari 'beauty' and arivai 'the charming lady'. It may also 
conceal an allusion to ari 'toddy', for the Carya-gTti-kosa says: 
"The customer who comes on seeing the signs of wine, seems to be 
the antarabhava citta, who now enters the vacuity where the lotus 
with 64 petals is located, without leaving any sign behind, and 
drinks the nectar from the lotus of great bliss" (Sastri 1977:688) 
The use of Tamil words in Sanskrit dharanis was a deliberate 
effort at charging the language with esoteric effects, as a 
special terminology or sandha-bhāṣa 'union of two meanings, the 
ordinary as well as the symbolic', the union of two divergent 
vocabularies by the insertion of Tamil words in Sanskrit mantras 
to render them more thaumaturgic in their unfathomable obscurity: 
the gods love the cryptic (paroksa-priyah devah). The special 
tantric terminology is also termed sandhya-bhāṣa 'the language 
intentionally vague, hidden and enigmatic as the twilight', for 
it points--without regrets--to the symbolism of the dusk or 
eventide (sandhya) which is joyfully ingrained in the .vocabulary 
of the vacuity where the lotus with 64 petals is located, and the 
"varuni or wine stands for the samvrtika bodhicitta or the semen 
virile. According to a particular belief of the yogins, when the 
sakti marches upwards through the nadīs, the sukra or the 
samvrtika bodhicitta also proceeds upwards to the head. The aim 
of the yogin is to see that is proceeds quietly through the 
middle naḍi after leaving the naḍīs on either side and gets 
accumulated in the vajramani in the head and loses its restless 
character" (Sastri 1977:688). The nocturnal intensities of 
mahamudra and mahasukha are clothed in the rapture and enigma of 
the mediative glory and depth of the sandhya-bhāṣa, accentuated 
by the use of exotic Tamil vocables, wherein samsara and nirvana

12
become one.
4. South India as a cradle of Parami tayana and Mantrayana
Sriparvata
4.1 The cradle of Paramita-yana, Mantrayana and Vajrayana 
was in South India, around śri parvata, Dhanyakataka, Potalaka 
and Oddiyana which are in Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu, and in 
the 8th century this area became an important centre for the 
transmission of tantras to Indonesia and China. Joshi (1967:329) 
opines: "It is therefore clearly established that the earliest 
seats of Tantrika Buddhism were not in Bengal, Orissa and Assam, 
but in Uddiyana and Andhradesa". From early centuries Southern 
India played a leading role in the development of Buddhism. 
Nagarjuna the founder of Mahayana (Lankavatara-sutra, BST.118) 
was a South Indian Brahmana, who rescued the prajna-parami ta 
from the nagas, from his hermitage at Sriparvata: 
"Daksinapatha-vedalyam bhiksuh śrTman mahay asah/ 
Nagahvayah sa namna tu sada sat-paksa-darakaḥ// 
Prakasya loke madyanam mahayanamanuttaram/".
4.2 Hsüan-tsang inform us that the Mahasanghikas had a 
dharani-pitaka (Beal 1884:2.165) and inscriptions prove that 
they were widely disseminated in An dhradesa (Joshi 1967:325).
4.3 The Nikayasangraha mentions the Vajraparvata and many 
Vajrayana works are attributed to the vajraparvata-vasi-nikaya. 
The Vajraparvata may be another name of Sri parvata because of 
its close association with Vajrayana (Joshi 1967:327). Sanskrit 
works, like the Harsacarita (Chowkhamba ed. p.9), Kadambarl 
(ed. Peterson p.224-8), Malati-madhava (1,8,10), and Rajatarah- 
gini of Kalhana 3.267,"tify to the repute of Sriparvata as a 
centre for attaining siddhi. The Manjusri-müla-kalpa (p.88) says 
that in Sriparvata and Dhanyakaṭaka one realises the mantras

13
quickly:
"Sriparvate Mahāśaile daksinapatha-sañjnike/ 
sridhanyak atake caitye jinadhatudhare bhuvi // 
sidhyante tatra mantra vai ksipram sarvarthakarmasu/".
4.4 Avatamsaka and South India. In the Avatamsaka-sutra 
Gandavyuha Buddha resides at Jetavana amidst an array of śravakas 
and Lokendras, who find it impossible to comprehend the great 
spiritual power of the Tathagata. In accordance with the wish 
of the assembly, Buddha enters the simha-vijṛmbhita samadhi and 
as a result miracles follow. "After this finale of miracles 
Mañjuśri departs for Dakṣinapatha, followed by Bodhisattvas, 
Lokendras and a host of six thousand bhiksus led by sari putra. 
Upon his arrival at the caitya of Vici trasaladhvaja near 
Dhanyakara inhabitants of this town turn out in large numbers to 
hear him" (Fontein 1967:6). From among the thousands who flock 
to the caitya, Mañjusri singles out Sudhana to receive instruct- 
ion in Supreme Knowledge. Mañjuśri advises and sends Sudhana off 
to the south and other regions to receive instruction in the 
conduct of the bodhisattva. In his pilgrimage Sudhana visits 
over 50 teachers. Among them are: Sagaramegha who had spent 
twelve years in meditation on the seashore at Sagaramukha, 
Supratisthita of Sagaratira on the way to Lanka, the dramida 
Megha of Vajrapura in Dramidapattana, Queen Asa who lives in the 
Samantavyuha forest at Samudravelati, sage Bhi smottara-nirghoṣa 
of Nalayur, and finally he reaches Maitreya who resides at the 
Mahavyuha kutagara in the country of SamudrakatTha. It is 
interesting to observe that the journey of Sudhana takes him to 
the South Indian city of Nalayur and to a number of places asso- 
ciated with the sea, which renders it likely that the composition 
of the Gandavyuha be associated with Southern India. The fact 
that Manjusri witnesses the marvels of the Buddha and returns to 
Daksinapatha corroborates the aforesaid contention. Behind the
right shoulder of Mañjusri appears a crescent-shaped ornament-- 
an attribute often associated with Manjuśrt. This crescent is

14
used to denote boys of supernatural descent, thus it came to be 
associated with gods or bodhisattvas of youthful appearance 
(kumārabhūta, Fontein 1971:145 fig.6). Mañjuśrī kumarabhuta bears 
affinity with Kumara or Murugan of Tamil. Avatamsaka was the 
first step in the evolution to the tantras connected with 
Vairocana and we cannot rule out the evolution of the Vairocana 
systems in the Tamil area, culminating in the carya, yoga and 
anuttara tantras. In the Abhidhanottara and Samvarodaya tantras 
the 24 heroes and dakinis are supposed to reside in different 
regions called Pullirmalaya, Jalandhara, Odiyana, etc. (Kalff 
1978:158). Pullirmalaya is a South Indian toponym. There are 
several South Indian cities beginning with Puli (y): Puliyur, 
Pullur, Pulluru (List of Indian Post and Telegraph Offices, 1954, 
p.567-568). This becomes more relevant when we remember that the 
Abhidhanottara and Samvarodaya tantras belong to the Prajña Tantra 
division which is also called the Dakini Tantra division (Kalff 
1978:149). The very word daka may be akin to Tamil takku < T. 
dāka 1. strength, robustness. 2. petulancy, pride (Tamil Lexicon 
3.1696).
4.5 In Japanese Vajrayana or Shingon, the ritual of the 
Mahakaruna-garbhadhatu mandala of the Mahavai ro cana-tantra and 
the Vajradhātu mandala of the Vajrasekhara-tantra has in between 
the ritual of Acala. Acala (Jap. Fudo) is the main deity (Jap. 
honzon) of homa (Toki 1899:142). Acala is an emanation of siva 
in Japan, and in the Tibetan tradition he is Canda Maharoṣaṇa. 
In the Tamil Lexi con (suppl. 314a) Candeśa is siva's seneschal. 
The role of Acala in the Japanese tradition and his Tibetan 
name indicate his evolution from Candesa in the predominantly 
Saiva area of Tamil. In the legend of the Avalokitesvara on the 
Potalaka mountain, Hsüan-tsang (Watters 1905:229) says: "to the 
people at the foot of the mountain who pray for a sight of the 
Bodhisattva, he appears sometimes as a Pasupata TTrthika or as 
Mahesvara". An instance of this syncretism is the Nflakantha- 
Lokeśvara-dhārani which represents Siva as the Thousand-eyed

15
Thousand-armed Lokeśvara Bodhisattva. It has been a very 
popular work in China since the later Sung dynasty (A.D.960-1127). 
It was translated into Chinese four times by Che-t'ung of 
Loyang (w.627-649, Nj.318, T.1057b), by Bhagavaddharma (w.650-660, 
Nj.320, T.1059,1060), and by Bodhi ruci in A.D.701 (Nj. 319, T.1058). 
The acculturation of Saiva into Buddhist tradition may have taken 
place in South India and thence it was transmitted to Indonesia 
where Siva-Buddha syncretism was deeply entrenced.
Mantrayana proclaimed at Dhanyakat aka/śrīdhanya
4.6 The Sekoddeśa-tika (pp. 3-4) by the great Vajrayāna 
teacher Naropa says that śridhanya is the place where 
Mantranaya was proclaimed: Śrīdhanye niyata-mantranaya-deśanā- 
sthane; the following is quoted from the mulatantra:
Grdhrakūte yathaśastah prajñāparami tānaye/
Tatha mantranaye prokta śrīdhanye dharmadeśana//
4.7 Hsüan-tsang (Watters 1905:2.215, Joshi 1967:325) 
confirms that Dhanyakaṭaka was famed for its shrine to Vajrapani. 
Avalokitesvara had directed Bhavaviveka to this shrine in the 
mountain to the south of the capital so that he would gain his 
desire on reciting the Vajrapāņi-dhāraṇī. A note added to 
Hsüan-tsang's text tells us that another name for the country was 
"Great Andhra" (Be al 1884:2.220 n.97).
4.8 According to the Tibetan tradition, it was at the 
Stupa of Dhanyakataka that Buddha gave initiation into the 
Vajradhātu mahamandala and the mula-tantra of the Kalacakra: 
"Before this last deed, on the fifteenth day of the fourth month 
of the Iron-dragon year of the Nam-non cycle, at the stupa of 
Dhanyakaṭaka in South India, Buddha arose in the bodily form of 
the main deity of the Kalacakra mandala before King Sucandra 
(Zla-ba-bzan-po) and a host of countless gods, nagas and men of 
such places as the ninety-six districts of Sambhala Further,
he gave there the initiation into the great mandala of Vajradhatu

16
and the root text of the Kalacakra Tantra. King Sucandra 
recorded all this in writing and upon returning to Sambhala, con- 
structed a three-dimensional Kalacakra mandala and composed 
12,000 commentaries to the mula tantra" (adapted from Gar-je 
K'am-trul Rinpoche, A geography and history of Shambala, The 
Tibet Journal 3.3/19787:6).
4.9 Taranatha (Chimpa/ Chattopadhyaya 1970:209) says that 
Candragomin went from Nalanda to Dhanyakaṭaka caitya to worship 
Tara and Avalokitesvara and thence to the Potala hill. Hsüan- 
tsang's journey took him to Kanci pura the capital of the Dravida 
country (Beal 1884:2.228), and 3000 li south from this he came 
to the Malakūṭa country in which was situated Mount Potalaka the 
abode of Avalokitesvara.
5. Kanci as a fountainhead of Buddhism
5.1From very early times Kanci had become a cradle of 
Buddhism.In the excavations at Kanci pura, a Buddhist shrine 
has been uncovered, and there has also come to light a greyware 
sherd with Brahmi letters of the first-second century A.D. which 
have been read as Pu ta li ti sa (Champaklakshmi 1978:116).
Kanci pura as a centre of Pali Buddhism
5.2 The Gandhavamsa says that Kāñcī pura, Avanti and 
Arimaddana were the three renowned centres of Theravada. Buddha- 
ghosa confirms this in his Manorathapuraṇī, and further points 
out that he wrote this work on the request of Jotipala while
both were residing at Kanci pura. Buddhaghosa refers to Srinivasa
or Siripala as the king of Kanci pura in his Samantapasādi kā.
5.3 The Tamil Thera Buddhadatta, who lived in the fifth 
品
century under the patronage of the Cola king Kalabhra Accuta- 
vikkanta, was the abbot of several Buddhist monasteries, includ- 
ing those at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka and at Kanci pura.

17
5.4 The Gandhavamsa names ten South Indian Theras who 
wrote Pali works: Buddhadatta, Ananda, Dhammapala, two unnamed, 
Maha-vajirabuddhi, Culla-vaji rabuddhi, DIpahkara alias Buddha- 
priya, Culla-dhammapala, and Kassapa. This work also refers to 
twenty other Theravada teachers who wrote in Pali at Kanci pura. 
Among the ten Theras, Dhammapala (5-6th century A.D.) headed the 
Bhataraditta Vihara at Kanci pura and DI pankara Thera (1100 A.D.) 
became the head of the Baladicca Vihara at Kanci pura.
5.5 Anuruddha (12th centuryof the Pandya land, whose Pali 
works were popular in Ceylon and Burma, headed the Mulasoma 
Vihara at Kanci pura. For the last eight centuries his Abhidhamm- 
attha-sangaha has served as a textbook for abhidhamma philosophy 
in the Pali countries till our times.
5.6 "South India continued to be the centre of Pali 
Buddhism as late as the 12th century A.D. The Kalyani stone 
inscriptions of King Dhammadazedi (Dhammaceti 1472-1492 A.D.) 
and the Sasanavansa of Paññasami (A.D. 1861) give an account of 
Chapada who returned to Burma during the reign of King Anawratha 
(10th century A.D.), taking with him to Arimaddananagara (city 
of Pagan) five Buddhist savants well-versed in the Pali lore, 
two of whom, namely, Ananda Thera and Rahula Thera, were resi- 
dents of Kanci pura. Ananda Thera (died 1245 A.D.) was a native 
of Kanci puram, who was taken to Arimarddanapura in Burma by 
Saddharma Jyoti Pala, where the Burmese king Jayasura received 
him with great honours and loaded him with presents including an 
elephant which he sent to his relatives at Kanci. Ananda was 
the head of the Burmese Buddhist Church for about fifty years 
and died in 1245 A.D." (Ramachandran 1954:7).
5.7 It may be remembered that Dinnaga was a native of Kanci, 
lived there for a long time in the early part of his life, went 
to Ayodhya to learn from Vasubandhu and ultimately settled down 
at Kanci.
5.8 Prior to the third century A.D., Kanci played a promi- 
nent role as one of the four capitals of the Tamil area, the

18
other three being Puhar, Madura and Vanji.
These four capitals
are mentioned in the Tamil work Mani mekhalai. Alongwith the 
Silappadhikaram, the two are outstanding Tamil classics of the 
Sangam period and constitute a twin epic: "the subject-matter of 
the two is one continuous story, and describes what befell a 
householder and his wife of the city of Puhar, and, as a 
consequence, the renunciation of the daughter of the hero of her 
life as the first courtezan of the Chola capital".
5.9 The author of the Mani mekhalai Sattan (from Skt.śāstā = 
Buddha), figures among the traditional Fortynine of the Third 
Tamil Sangam (according to Champaklakshmi 1976:116 the Mani- 
mekhalai is a post-Sangam work of about the fifth century A.D.). 
His only important work is the Mani mekhalai, whose main purpose 
is the exhaltation of Buddhism as a religion and philosophy. The 
Silappadhikaram contributes to this end in a general way. It is 
remarkable that two of the greatest Tamil classics are Buddhist 
works, for Buddhism held sway in the Tamil area.
5.10 Mani mekhalai found enough to learn of Buddhism in the 
initial stages at Puhar. She also learnt all that the heretical 
teachers had to teach at Vanji. She happened to see her grand- 
father there in the Buddhist vihara outside the fortress. The 
grandfather requested her to proceed to Kanci which was suffering 
from a severe famine and to relieve the acute distress by her in- 
exhaustible alms bowl that she carried. in her hand. Her grand- 
father also advised her that at Kanci alone could she get the most 
authoritative teaching of Buddhism from Aravana Adigal. At the 
direction of her grandfather Maņi mekhala flew through air to Kanci. 
She was received by the viceroy, Ilam Killi and was alloted 
accommodation in the southwestern corner of the city in a grove 
called Dharmadavana, where from she fed the suffering people fr om 
her inexhaustible bowl much to the relief of all. The grateful 
viceroy provided for her a big new vihara with all necessary 
appurtenances for her residence in the city and did all else she 
wanted. She got a Buddha seat erected and a special caitya for

19
holding the footprints of the Buddha, and received the teaching 
of Aravana Adigal, as she was not satisfied with all that she had 
learnt earlier. Chapter 19 of the poem details Buddhist logic 
that Adigal teaches to Maṇimekhala, and he is introduced as a 
Buddhist saint of the highest reputation in Tamil area at the 
time. The epic gives an elaborate description of the town of 
Kanci where Manimekhala ultimately attained enlightenment. So 
during the period to which the story of Mani mekhalai refers, 
Kanci was still a Cola viceroyalty, and the viceroy at the time 
was a younger brother of the reigning Cola (Aiyang ar 1928:20-21). 
"No princely viceroy of the Cola was possible in Kanci after 
A.D.300, from which period we have a continuous succession of 
Pallava rulers holding sway in the region" (Ai yang ar 1928: xxviii). 
5.11 The Dhyana school (Jap. Zen-shu) of Buddhism is 
associated intimately with Kanci. It was introduced into China 
by the Indian teacher Bodhidharma, who was the third son of a 
king of Kanci. He reached China in A.D.520 or 527. He had 
transmitted a copy of the Lankavatara-sutra to his disciple 
Hui-k'o (traditional dates A.D.487-593, Fontein and Hickman 
1970:xv,2). The title of Lankavatara indicates the likelihood 
of this text having been written at Kanci which was "situated 
on the mouth of the southern sea of India, looking towards the 
kingdom of Simhala" (Beal 1911:139). It was the port for sailing 
to Lanka: the Lanka-avatara. Tantric commentators "quote the 
Lankavatara-sutra for their Yogacara-type vocabulary, and this 
sutra was first translated into Chinese in 443 A.D. and in the 
fifth century had become so popular among Indian Buddhists that 
it was the chief text of Bodhidharma when he came to China in 
either 520 A.D. or 527 A.D. (the alternate dates of the Sino- 
Japanese tradition)" (Wayman 1977:97). The Vajrasekhara-tantra 
which took form in the South is closely related to yogacara 
(Malalasekera 1973:379b). This relationship may conceal in it 
the history of the development from yogacara to the yoga-tantras 
(of which Vajrasekhara-tantra is the second fundamental text) in 
the Kanci region itself. It requires further investigation.

20
5.12 Dharmapala (A.D.528-560) the head of the Nalanda od 
monastery was the eldest son of a minister of Kanci (Raghavan 
1976:8). His disciple was the famous SIlabhadra of Nālandā, 
under whom Hsuan-tsang studied.
5.13 Mahendravarman in his Mattavilasa-prahasana gives 
additional proof of the existence of a Buddhist vihara in Kanci 
in the early part of the seventh century A.D. (Champaklakshmi 
1978:116).
5.14 In A.D.640 Hsuan-tsang stayed at Kanci (Watters 
1905:2.335) where he halted for some time in the hope of visiting 
Sri Lanka (Be al 1911:139). Shaman Hwui-li in his biography of 
Hsuan-tsang makes some important observations (Beal 1911:138,139) 
that Kanci pura was the capital of the Dravida Kingdom and it "is 
situated on the mouth (bay) of the southern sea of India, looking 
towards the kingdom of Simhala, distant from it three days' 
voyage". Hsüan-tsang had come to Kanci for going to Srilanka, 
but prior to his departure the king of Sinhala died and the 
country was in disorder, so much so that Bodhi megheśvara and 
Abhayadamṣṭra with three hundred priests left the country and 
arrived at Kanci pura. Hwui-li continues:
"The Master of the Law, having obtained an interview with 
them, asked them as follows: "It is reported that the chief 
priests of your kingdom are able to explain the Tripitaka accord- 
ing to the Sthavira school, and also the Yoga-sastra. I am 
anxious to go there and study these books. May I ask why you 
have come to this place?" In reply, they said: "The king of our 
country is dead: and the people are suffering from famine, without 
any resource for help"...
"Moreover, among the members of our school who know the Law 
there are none who excel ourselves as to age and position; if you 
have any doubts therefore, let us, according to your will, speak 
together about these things".
"The Master of the Law A.e. Hsuan-tsang] then gave examples 
of choice passages of the Yoga-sastra, both long and short sections,

21
but they were not able to explain any of them as S1labhadra did". 
In the above passage we find the expression: "are able to 
explain the Tripitaka according to the Sthavira school, and also 
the Yoga-sastra", which refers to the wide-ranging dimension of 
the knowledge of the Srilanka monks who were well-versed in the 
most ancient Theravada tradition as well as the latest system of 
yü-ch'ieh-lun. Beal translates yü-ch'ieh-lun as yoga-sastra. In 
fact yü-ch'ieh-lun means the yoga-tantras. At the end, in 
"choice passages of the yoga-sastra" the Chinese text has the 
term yu-ch'ieh which is a transcription of yoga. In fact, the term 
yü-ch'ieh 'yoga' is employed by Vajrabodhi (who arrived in China 
in A.D.719 and died there in A.D.732), to denote the yoga-tantras, 
and he is the great teacher who introduced this genre of tantra 
in China by translating the Vajrasekhara-tantra into Chinese. An 
abridged version of the Vajrasekhara translated for recitation 
(Nj.534) in A.D.723 has yü-ch'ieh for yoga-tantra. An extract 
from the Vajrasekhara on the rites of Cintamani cakra--Avaloki- 
tesvara (Nj.538) was translated by Vajrabodhi in A.D.730. Its 
Chinese title is Kuan-tzu-tsai ju-i-lun p'u-sa yü-ch'ieh fa-yao, 
whose word-to-word equivalence would be: Avalokitesvara cintamani- 
cakra bodhisattva yoga vidhi. It has been mis-translated by 
Nanjio as "The importance of the law of Yoga of the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara-cintacakra (or -mani?). The correct translation 
is: "Rites of Cintamani cakra Avalokitesvara according to the 
yoga-tantras". Here yoga connotes the system of yoga-tantras. 
Similarly, in other works translated by Vajrabodhi during 
A.D.723-730, namely in Nj.1033, 1427, 1430, yü-ch'ieh 'yoga' 
stands for yoga-tantras.
5.15 Vajrabodhi was assisted, and later followed, by his 
disciple Amoghavajra (in China from 719 to 741 and again from 
746 to 774) in the translation of yoga-tantras from Sanskrit into 
Chinese. Amoghavajra employed the term yü-ch'ieh ta-chiao-wang 
(Nj.1022) yoga maha-tantra-raja, where tantra was translated as 
chiao. Elsewhere yü-ch'ieh, the transcription of yoga, serves as
MA

22
a technical equivalent of yoga-tantra: Nj.1036, 1044, 1052, 1319, 
1383, 1389, 1390, 1400, 1411, 1428, 1433, 1443, 1447, 1448, 1453. 
This serves to confirm that Hsüan-tsang was referring to the yoga- 
tantras, and thus Hwui-li's biography of his master preserves an 
important evidence of the presence of teachers of yoga-tantras 
at Kanci in the seventh century.
5.16 Hsüan-tsang in his Si-yu-ki (Beal 1884:2.229) points 
out that Kanci had 'some hundred of' monasteries, ten thousand 
monks, and there was a stupa about 100 feet high which was built 
by king Aśoka.
5.17 The South Indian śramana, Bodhi ruci (Nj. p.442 no.150) 
worked in China during A.D. 693-713 and translated 53 works into 
Chinese. Among them are tantric texts like the Adhyardhaśatika 
Prajñāpāramitā (Nj.18, T.240) and the Ekakṣara-Usnī sacakravarti- 
sūtra (I-tzu fo-ting-lun-wang ching, Nj.532, T.951) which was 
translated in A.D.709. Prof. Seigai Omura has explained the 
mandalas expounded in these sutras translated by Bodhi ruci in the 
second volume of his History of the Development of Esoteric 
Buddhism (Lokesh Chandra 1972:34). Another nexus between tantras 
and South India.
5.18 The Eight Patriarchs of Shingon or Japanese Vajrayana 
who transmitted the doctrine and rites are (Saunders 1964:149): 
Nagarjuna, Nagabodhi, Vajrabodhi (A.D.670-741), Subhakarasimha 
(A.D.637-735), Amoghavajra (A.D. 705-774), I-hsing (A.D.683-727), 
Hui-kuo (A.D. 746-805), Kōbō Daishi (A.D. 774-835).
Tantric Buddhism was carried to East Asia by Vajrabodhi of 
Kanci who "according to his biography, travelled to southern India 
at the age of 31 and began a seven-year period of study under 
Nagabodhi, a disciple of Nagarjuna. At this time, it is recorded, 
he studied the Vajrasekhara-yoga-sutra... According to a Chinese 
source Vajrabodhi's birthdate is conjectured as 671 A.D., and so 
his thirty-first year would correspond to the year 701 A.D." 
(Matsunaga 1977:178). Nagarjuna is an eminent authority on the

23
Tantras in the Tibetan tradition as well. In the Blue Annals 
2.753 it is clear that the yoga and anuttara yoga tantras spread 
from the south: "the acarya Nagarjuna and his disciples obtained 
the yoga-tantras, including the Guhyasamaja and others (the 
anuttara-yoga-tantras, were also called mahayoga-tantras...), and 
preached them. They spread from the South. After that Kambala 
and others discovered the yogini-tantras in the country of 0-di- 
yan. They also spread towards Madhyadeśa". Nagarjuna is asso- 
ciated with the construction of an Iron Stupa in South India, 
which is illustrated in the Kakuzen-sho 'collection of Kakuzen' 
written and drawn by him about A.D. 1183-1213, reproduced in the 
I conographic Section of the Taishō edition of the Chinese 
Tripitaka, vol.5 no.103.392. The term 'iron' is a translation of 
loha which in Tamil means 'metal'. As a holy monument the stupa 
could not have been overlaid with iron only, but with seven or 
nine metals including precious metals as is usual in sacred archi- 
tecture. Thus the phrase 'iron stupa' in its mistranslation con- 
ceals a Tamil nuance.
5.19 The third Patriarch Vajrabodhi was the son of the 
royal preceptor of the Pallava kings of Kanci. Thus the Chinese 
and Japanese sources provide positive evidence of the vogue of 
tantras in South India and even at Kanci itself which to them was 
the original home for the dissemination of tantric learning.
5.20 For seven years Vajrabodhi studied the Vajrasekhara- 
tantra and ather tantric texts under Nagabodhi in South India 
(Takakusu 1956:151). Amoghavajra "first received the transmission 
from Vajrabodhi, the Tripitaka Master, and moreover visited the 
Acharya Nagabodhi in Southern India and acquired completely the 
Vajrasekhara Sutra comprising eighteen divisions" (Hakeda 1972:143) 
5.21 In the 8-9th century A.D. when the Vaisnava Alvar 
Tirumangai of Tiruvali-Tirunagari came upon the scene, the vihāra 
at Nagapattinam was so flourishing that it had a Buddha image of 
solid gold, as narrated in the Guru-paramparai (Arayirappadi) of 
the twelfth century, which is one of the hagiologies of Tamil

24
Vaisnavism (Ramachandran 1954:15).ved ed
5.22 The biographies (Bagchi 1938:2.583) of Prajña of 
Kapisa (worked in China A. D. 785-810) point out that at the age of 
23 years he entered Nalanda and studied the sutras and sastras 
which included the Vajrasekhara (Bagchi: Kin kang king). He went 
to the country of Chen-li where he stayed for 18 years. He learnt 
the speech of South India where they persue the guhya-pitaka or 
vidyadhara-pitaka and practise strange rites. Thereafter he 
proceeded to the South were he studied the yoga tantra, mandala 
and mudra of the 'five families' in more than 3000 gathas. Here 
South India should refer to Kanci, for in the life of Hsuan-tsang 
(Nanking wood print, chapter 4 folio 6b line 9) Dravida has the 
gloss nan-yin 'South India' in miniscule letters, and the capital 
of Draviḍa was Kanci pura.
5.23 Thereafter, Prajña studied the language of CTna or 
China. He embarked on a boat destined for Kuang-chou, but the 
outbreak of a tempest took it to the island of Srilanka. Thence 
by the route of the Southern Sea he arrived at Kuang-fu in 
A.D.781. He took residence at Ch'ang-an, worked there till 
A. D. 810, and translated eight Sanskrit works into Chinese.
5.24 The biography of Prajña is a clear indication that 
South India was a renowned centre of Tantric philosophy, art and 
ritual. Prajña studied the Chinese language and embarked for 
China from a South Indian port. This goes to show that South 
India in this context refers to Kanci, which is described by 
Hwui-li as: "The town of Kin-chi is the opening (mouth) of the 
southern sea of India, and in the direction of Sinhala the water 
journey is three days'. It seems to imply that Conjiveram was 
the central town from which the traffic to Ceylon was conducted" 
(Beal 1884:2.228). As a major port and capital of the Dravida 
kingdom, Kanci must have been frequented by rich Chinese merchants 
and it is from them that Prajña could acquire a knowledge of
Chinese.

25
5.25 In China, Prajña taught Sanskrit to Kōbō Daishi, the 
founder of Shingon or Vajrayana in Japan (Hakeda 1972:33). He 
gave Sanskrit manuscripts to Kobo Daishi: "With the pledge to 
transmit the torch of the Dharma, I came to China. I wish to 
sail for Japan, but circumstances do not allow me to fulfil my 
intention. Take with you the new Avatamsaka Sutra and the Sat- 
Paramita Sutra, both of which I have translated, and the se 
Sanskrit manuscripts. I sincerely hope that these will help 
create conditions in which to propogate Buddhism so that people 
will be saved" (Hakeda 1972:149). In the years A.D.796-798 Prajña
translated anew the Avatamsaka-sutra in 40 fasciculi. It is 
important to note that at the end there is a letter addressed to 
the Chinese Emperor from the King of Wu-ch'a (Uda) in South India, 
who presented his own copy of the Sanskrit text to the Chinese 
Emperor in A.D.795 (Nj.89). Here Wu-ch'a (Uda) is explicity 
stated to be situated in South India, and it can be none other 
than Uddiyana/Kanci. The search for authentic Sanskrit manus- 
cripts preceded the Chinese translations of Buddhist texts. A 
century earlier, the Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka in 
80 fasciculi was completed by Sikṣananda in A.D.695-699 after the 
Empress Wu Tsö-t'ien had sent a special envoy to Khotan for the 
Sanskrit text of this sutra (Nj.88). It was perfectly natural 
that when Prajña wanted to procure an authentic manuscript of the 
Avatamsaka, he must have requested the Chinese Emperor to get it 
from Oddiyana. The year A.D.795 when the Avatamsaka manuscript 
reached China is significant. It was prior to the years 
A.D.796-798 during which Prajña was engaged in its translation.
6. Transmission from South India to the East and Northwest 
The oldest of the texts of its genre the Aṣṭasahasrikā 
Prajñaparamita (ed. BST.112) clearly states that the Parami t'anaya 
(Joshi 1967:345) originated in the South (Dakṣinapatha) and 
spread to the east and later flourished in Uttarapatha i.e. the

26
North-west of India: ime khalu punaḥ śari putra satpāramita- 
pratisamyuktaḥ sūtrāntāstathāgatasyatyayena daksinapathe pracari- 
syanti, dakṣinapathāt punareva vartanyam pracarisyanti, vartanyah 
punar uttarapathe pracari syanti. Haribhadra in his Aloka (ed.
BST:427). Vartanyam iti purvadese. The Parami tayana developed 
into Mantrayana (Lessing/Wayman 1968:21), and this confirms that 
the route of transmission of Mantrayana was from the South to the 
Northwest. The South Indian monks were great wanderers who roamed 
far and wide disseminating Buddhism. An inscription in one of the 
apsidal temples at Nagarjunikonda (EI.20.22-23) actually records 
a donation for nuns and monks who in their journeys to faraway 
lands had visited Kaśmīra, Gandhara, Vanga, Vanavāsī, Aparanta, 
Yavana (?), and Tamraparni (Sri Lanka) (Weiner 1977:34).
7. Conclusion
The evidence of different Buddhist traditions points to the 
origin of Pāramitāyāna and Mantrayana in the South and its spread 
thence to other regions of India. The linguistic evidence of the 
word Oddiyana itself, the presence of South Indian vocables in 
dharaṇīs, the unanimous traditions about the origination of 
tantras in various places of Southern India, and the fact that 
Kanci was a cradle of Buddhism as well as a centre for the disse- 
mination of Vajrayana to East Asia: all converge to the conclusion 
that Oddiyana is Kanci.

LOKESH CHANDRA
THE ORIGIN OF AVALOKITA-SVARA/AVALOKIT-ESVARA
Complex systems of thought lie embedded in the silent enigmas 
of Avalokita-svara Avalokit-eśvara
ZLokeśvara. From an at- 
tendant acolyte of Amitabha in the Sukhāvati-vyuha, A. gained 
independence as a separate deity in his own right, while the wor- 
ship of his prototype Brahma ceased, until the great Adi-Sankarā- 
cārya resurrected Brahma (masc.) as the abstract Brahman (neut.). 
The Potala Lokeśvara holds the mysteries of Harihara, the Deva- 
rāja cult and a key to the enigmatic faces at Angkor. From hymns 
he has incarnated into statues to become Things of our earth, to 
celebrate the cosmos in the surety of living, to carry eternal depths 
to the eyes of the faithful of the earth: beauté (fem.) or beauty 
sculpted in the round, to give birth to a state of open symbolism. 
These psychotrophic images open meditative worlds of well-being, 
happiness and bliss so that the human possesses all becomings. 
Common men exalt their being in the vision of these images of 
Avalokita-svara sublimed by words (svara) of transcendance.
The etymology and theogony of Avalokita-svara/Avalokit-eśvara 
has been discussed by several scholars, like Burnouf (1844), Grün- 
wedel (1900), Zimmer (1922), Mironov (1927), Vallée Poussin (1909), 
Takakusu (1914), Staël-Holstein (1936), Mallmann (1948), Yutaka 
(1982), and several others. These views have been detailed in ex- 
tenso by Mallmann (1948: 59-82 le nom d'Avalokiteçvara) and hence 
we shall not repeat all the observations. All of them have missed

188Lokesh Chandra
the origin of A. and thus the etymology and variants of the name 
have remained obscure.
NOMENCLATURE
Three forms of the Sanskrit name are found: (i) Avalokita, (ii) 
Avalokita-svara, (iii) Avalokit-eśvara.
Avalokita. The name Avalokita occurs in Santideva's Bodhi- 
caryāvatāra 2.51 (7th cent.): tam cAvalokitam nātham. Prajñākara- 
mati's commentary (edited by L. de la Vallée Poussin, 1901:66) on 
this stanza: sa bhagavan Avalokitaḥ. The great Sanskrit-German 
dictionary PW cites Avalokita = Avalokitesvara from the three dic- 
tionaries: Trikāṇḍaśeṣa, Anekārthasangraha, and Medini. Avalokito 
nā Lokanathe, tṛṣu nirikṣite (Medini-kośa 1940:71.230). The Anek- 
ārtha-sangraha of Hemacandra 5.20 says Avalokitas tu Buddhe, apy 
avalokitam ikṣite. The Tibetan name Spyan-ras-gzigs is an honorific 
literary translation of Avalokita.
Staël-Holstein (1936:357) cites « Lord Avalokita » from Kern's 
English version of the Saddharmapuṇḍarika-sūtra (SBE 21.406-407), 
which is wrong. The Sanskrit text clearly has the word Avalokite- 
śvara throughout. He cites Avalokita-lokeśvara from Cordier 2.154 
(21) which is a reconstruction by Cordier, whereas the original Tibe- 
tan xylograph has the transliteration Avalokitesvara. He quotes 
Avalokita from Cordier 2.308 (63), 2.316 (128, 129, 130)). All these 
four titles are reconstructions and are without value. Bhattacharyya 
(1958:411 fig. 44) illustrates Avalokita Lokeśvara, which is Avaloki- 
teśvara Lokeśvara in the drawings of Siddhimuni Sakya (Lokesh 
Chandra 1981:44 fig. 64). Even this entry is doubtful. I (1981) have 
shown that the names of the 108 Lokeśvaras (not Avalokitesvaras) 
in Bhattacharyya are misread in several places, and are unreliable. 
Staël-Holstein (1936:352) cites the Chinese Kuan-shih-tzu-tsai
# from Hsi-yü Chi (T. 51.883b) and Eitel's Handbook 25. 
Though the Chinese can be literally rendered as Avalokita-lokeśva- 
ra, this compound is not attested anywhere in Sanskrit. In fact, 
loka was deemed to be implicit in Avalokita. Avalokita was early 
understood as including loka. So the Chinese Kuan-shih-tzu-tsai 
cannot be taken for certain as standing for Avalokita-lok-eśvara.

The Origin of Avalokita-svara / Avalokit-eśvara189
Avalokit-eśvara. This name occurs in the Sanskrit version of 
the Sukhāvati-vyuha for the first time. The Sukhāvati-vyuha was 
translated into Chinese by Sanghavarman in A. D. 252 (Nj 27, K 26). 
Sanghavarman translated A. as Kuan-shih-yin(lit.* Ava- 
lokita-loka-svara, a compound not met with in any Sanskrit text). 
Kuan-shih-yin stands for Avalokita-svara. Mallmann (1948:71) dis- 
cusses the Chinese term at length. The translation of Sanghavarman 
raises a doubt whether the original reading in the third-century 
Sanskrit manuscript was not Avalokita-svara. The name Avalokite- 
śvara seems to be later, influenced by Iśvara =Śiva, which shows 
the interaction of Saivism and the worship of Avalokitesvara. This 
name had crystallized by the time when Hsüan-tsang completed 
his Travels/Hsi-yü Chi in A.D. 646. In the third chapter of his Tra- 
vels (T. 51.883b) Hsüan-tsang opines that Kuan-tzu-tsai =Avalokite- 
śvara is the correct name. By his time Avalokitesvara must have 
been the prevalent name (Staël-Holstein 1936:354).
Avalokita-svara occurs five times on one incomplete leaf of an 
ancient Sanskrit manuscript of the fifth century written in Indian 
characters which has been found in Eastern Turkestan. It is a frag- 
ment of the 24th chapter of the Saddharma-punḍarīka-sutra, brought 
back by Count K. Otani's expedition. < As the name occurs five 
times on an incomplete leaf, the possibility of a clerical error is 
hardly admissible. The circumstance is especially important, as 
the Petrovsky ms. of Saddharma-pundarika-sutra from Kashgar 
has the usual form Avalokitesvara. Thus a hereto missing link bet- 
ween the Indian and Chinese traditions seems to have been found. 
It cannot be doubted that Avalokitasvara was the original form, 
later supplanted by Avalokitesvara » (Mironov 1927:243). That this 
is not a scribal error is clear from the Sanskrit-Chinese dictionary 
of Fa-yün compiled in A. D. 1151, Fan-i Ming-i Chi * (T
2131, 54.1062a, Nj 1640) which admits that sutras written north of 
the Himalayas have svara meaning << sound » (instead of śvara) 
(Staël-Holstein 1936:353). Ch'ang-kuan the fourth patriarch of the 
Avataṁsaka school states in his commentary on the Avataṁsaka- 
vaipulya-sūtra written during A. D. 784-787 (KS 1, Nj 1589, T 1735): 
<< In the Sanskrit originals themselves two different names of the 
Bodhisattva occur. It is due to this difference in the Sanskrit origi-

190Lokesh Chandra
nals that the Chinese translators of these same originals differ as 
to the names of the Bodhisattva » (Staël-Holstein 1936:353-354).
Chih Ch'ien, in his translation of the Vimalakirti-nirdeśa (T 
474, Nj 147) done in the years A. D. 223-228 (K 120), translates Ava- 
lokita-svara (T 14.519b, Staël-Holstein 1936:354 n. 9). Kumā- 
rajīva who translated the same sutra 178 years later in A. D. 406 
(K. 119) rendered A. by the earlier and popular name Kuan-shih-yin 
(T 475:14.537b, Nj 146) wherein the final element is svara.
The name Kuan-yin= Avalokita-svara occurs in the title 
of two commentaries (T 1726 =: Nj 1555, T 1728=1557) of Chisha 
daishi the founder of the Tendai sect who lived from A. D. 538 to 
598 (Hobogirin 1978:238-239).
From the above we come to the following conclusions:
(1) The Chinese sources clearly indicate that there were two 
forms of the Sanskrit name: Avalokita-svara and Avalokit-eśvara. 
(2) The earliest Sanskrit name was Avalokita-svara.
(3) With the seeping in of Saiva influence the name became 
Avalokit-eśvara (Iśvara = Śiva). This process can be seen clearly in 
the Nilakantha or Potala Lokeśvara/Avalokitesvara (Lokesh Chan- 
dra 1979).
(4) During the indeterminate phase when it was not clear as to 
which of the two names Avalokita-svara or Avalokit-eśvara should 
be used, the abbreviated form Avalokita must have become popular, 
as in evidenced by Sanskrit texts and the widely prevalent Tibetan 
Spyan-ras-gzigs = Avalokita.
(5) The reconstructed forms* Avalokita-lokeśvara and * Avalo- 
kita-loka-svara used by Poussin, Staël-Holstein and others without 
any indication that they are artificial creations and continued by 
Mallmann, lead to confusion. They should be avoided.

From the above chronological synopsis of Chinese names, six 
points are clear:
(1) The earliest name was Avalokita-svara, as evidenced by Chih 
Ch'ien's translation K'uei-yin.
(2) When the original meaning got dimmed, the Chinese translators 
took the term loka « world » (Chin. shih) implied in ava- 
lokita (Yutaka 1982:14) and translated A. as Kuan-shih-yin << He 
who listens to the cries of the world ». This was part of the 
developing bhakti trend in Buddhism wherein the prime func- 
tion of A. came to be to hearken to the needs of his devotees 
in the world. Kumārajīva popularized this term by his use in 
the Lotus Sutra in A. D. 406.
(3) I have not been able to ascertain the earliest use of the name 
Kuan-yin. It was employed in the sixth century by Chisha 
Daishi the founder of the Tendai sect in his commentary on 
Kumārajīva's separate translation of the chapter on Avalokite- 
śvara (Nj 137). Hence onwards the worship of Avalokita was 
adopted by all sects, and the name Kuan-yin, Jap. Kannon be- 
came popular.
(4) Till the time of Hsüan-tsang all the Chinese translations inva- 
riably end in yin « svara ».

The Origin of Avalokita-svara / Avalokit-eśvara193
(5) In A. D. 646, Hsüan-tsang translated Avalokit-eśvara as Kuan- 
tzu-tsai, where tzu-tsai = iśvara. For the first time he discarded 
the form ending in svara and adopted the form with iśvara, 
namely Avalokit-eśvara. This must have been the prevalent 
usage in India during his time. Fifty years later Sikṣānanda 
followed his usage.
(6) The alteration of svara and iśvara was explained by the fact 
that Svara = Iśvara, Sabda is Brahman, just as « the seminal 
Logos of the Stoics, when spoken of a single Power, is God 
Himself as the organic principle of the cosmic process... >> 
(ERE.8.134b).
THEOGONY OF A.
Fundamental cosmology of Heaven and Earth. The substantive 
origin and correct appellation of A. become intelligible when we 
go back to the very foundations. Both the Indic and Indo-European 
traditions have Father Heaven (dyaus pitar) and Mother Earth 
(prthivi matar). Dyāvā-pṛthivi « Heaven and Earth » are indissolubly 
connected in nature. Heaven and Earth as a divine pair are the 
source of all things. They occur as a pair in six hymns of the Rig- 
veda (Macdonell 126). The two are called rodasi, the two worlds, 
an expression occurring over a hundred times in the RV. The word 
rodasi continues to exist in the Russian language and it became the 
inspiring battle-cry of the Russians in the Second World War: 
zhivyat rodina mat = Sanskrit jivyāt rodasī mātā: Long live Mother 
Earth. The heaven was represented by Sakra and the earth (sahā) 
by Brahma: Sakro devānām Indro Brahma ca sahāmpatiḥ (Kāraṇ- 
ḍavyuha, ed. P. L. Vaidya 258.20). Heaven and Earth represent the 
totality of space, for supreme awareness takes place and is sancti- 
fied in spatial symbolism (Tucci 1949:1.263 n. 279). Lord Buddha as 
the Supreme Cakravartin of all space and time, is naturally atten- 
ded upon by Sakra the king (indra) of gods or heaven and by 
Brahma the lord of the earth (sahā). When Lord Buddha was born, 
Sakra and Brahma attended upon him: < it was accepted as abso- 
lute fact that only divine hands could be worthy of receiving the

194Lokesh Chandra
Bodhisattva when he came from his mother's body. ...Indra and 
Brahma officiated as midwives... On the early monuments with 
figures, Indra is closer at hand while Brahma is pushed further 
back because of the perspective, or even to the other side of the 
panel... When Hsüan-Tsang visited the park of Lumbini, he was 
shown the two places side by side: one where Indra had received 
and swaddled the miraculous infant and the other where the "Four 
Celestial Kings" had done the same with the same divine cloths >>> 
(Foucher 1963:33). When Lord Buddha attained Enlightenment, 
Brahma held a white parasol over His head (Buddhavaṁsa com- 
mentary, PTS.287), and offered a chain of jewels (ratna-dāma) as 
large as Sumeru (Khuddakapāṭha comm. PTS.171, Vinayapiṭaka 
comm. PTS.1.115, Visuddhimagga PTS.1.201). Brahma appeared to 
Lord Sakyamuni and said that if the World-honoured One, failed to 
teach the truth, the world would become darker than it already 
was. << As an outcome of the pleading of Brahma, śākyamuni deci- 
ded to teach the truth to which he had been enlightened. And when 
he had arrived at a method of making his message as easy to under- 
stand as possible, he concluded his weeks of meditation and began 
his teaching » (Mizuno 1980:30). In the Pali tradition Brahmā recited 
a verse exhorting the Buddha to preach as there were those who 
would understand (Samyutta-nikāya PTS.1.137f., 233), and he uttered 
a verse immediately after the nirvāṇa of Lord Buddha (Samyutta- 
nikaya 158, Digha-nikāya 2.157). Brahmā Sahāṁmpati was the senior- 
most of all Brahmās (jettha-mahā Brahmā, Dīgha-nikāya 2.36f., 
Digh. comm. 2.467, Dialogues of the Buddha 2.30 n.4).
Buddha the cakravartin attended by the Kings of Heaven and 
Earth Indra and Brahmā. Lord Buddha was and acted like a cakra- 
vartin. He turned the dharmacakra: the term dharmacakra-pravar- 
tana has been borrowed from the terminology of royalty. When 
Lord Buddha was to attain nirvāṇa, Ananda << asked how the cere- 
mony should be carried out. Shakyamuni replied that it should be 
the kind of funeral afforded to a cakravartin king and then ex- 
plained in detail » (Mizuno 1980:186). The Mahāpadana-sutta says 
the birth of a cakravartin is attended by the same miracles as that 
of a Buddha and likewise his youth. Both have the attributes of a 
mahāpuruṣa. A cakravartin deserves a stupa like a Buddha (Digha-

The Origin of Avalokita-svara / Avalokit-eśvara195
nikāya 2.143). « With the appearance of a Cakkavatti there appear 
seven treasures in the world; similarly, with the appearance of a 
Tathāgata there appear the seven treasures of wisdom-mindfulness, 
searching of the Dhamma, energy, zest, tranquillity, concentration, 
equanimity » (Cakkavatti-sutta of Samyutta-nikāya 5.99, Malalase- 
kera 1937:1.833). As the supreme cakravartin Lord Buddha was 
attended on by the Lords of both Heaven and Earth, namely, Indra 
and Brahmā. Sharma (1978:37-39) has collected references to them 
from Mahāvastu, Divyāvadāna, Avadāna-śataka, and Jātaka-mālā. 
As acolytes of the Buddha, the two divine kings became symbolized 
as brahma ca kṣtram ca of the Ṛgveda, namely, knowledge and 
power, widsom and impirium. They thus entered a world of creati- 
vity and of new mythopoetics: now they could be transformed and 
transcreated.
Indra and Brahma flank Lord Buddha in sculpture. Brahmā 
and Indra attend on Lord Buddha as adorants in the oldest sculp- 
tures from Gandhara and Mathura. They stand to His left and 
right. Their position to the left or right is not fixed in the early 
images. Brahma has the hairdo of an ascetic and Indra wears a 
turban. Images from Gandhara, Butkara I and Swat show Brahma 
and Indra entreating the Buddha to preach (Leeuw 1979:fig. 11, 12, 
13, 32, 33, 34, 35). So does a relief in the Peshawar Museum (Leeuw 
1949:176 fig. 25). The Kaniska reliquary found in the great stūpa at 
Shāh-ji-ki Dheri of the reign of Kanişka I shows Indra and Brahmā 
with hands folded in añjali flanking the Buddha (Dobbins 1971:25, 
Leeuw 1949:99). The two divine kings flank the seated Buddha of 
the kapardin type found at Katrā (Mathura Museum, Leeuw 1949: 
fig. 31), another broken image of a seated Buddha of the kapardin 
type now at Boston (Leeuw 1949:fig. 32), a relief found in the Jail 
Mound at Mathura (Lucknow Museum, Leeuw 1949:fig. 33). Brahmā 
and Indra formed a « permanent couple » on either side of the 
Master. This tradition goes back to very ancient aniconic times 
when we find the two great gods in adoration of an empty seat 
under the Bodhi tree on a railing pillar from Mahaban (Mathura 
Museum no.2663, Leeuw 1949:176 n. 111). In the Gupta and Pala 
sculptures, Brahma can be recognized by his four heads and Indra 
by his vajra.

Transcendance of Buddha, Indra and Brahma. With the rise of 
transcendental tendencies in Buddhism, Sakyamuni the Man was 
replaced by Amitabha. His historic Enlightenment was transcended 
into Supreme Enlightenment whose illumination became the new 
dynamized centre reflected in the new Tathāgata Amitabha. A deli- 
berate effort was made to change the morphology and nomencla- 
ture of an emerging form of Buddhism, and to emphasize its un- 
ceasing development. The Larger Sukhāvati-vyuha is set forth by 
Šākyamuni to a question by Ananda. The Buddha relates that there 
was a line of 81 Tathāgatas beginning with Dipankara and ending 
with Lokeśvararāja. In the period of Lokeśvararāja, Dharmākara 
a king turned monk resolves to become a Buddha. Dharmakara 
meditates and reappears before Lokeśvararāja. He describes at 
length the land of bliss or Sukhāvatī in his 48 vows. All the details 
are related by Sakyamuni to Ananda who thereupon asks the 
present whereabouts of Dharmakara. Sākyamuni replies that he is 
reigning in Sukhāvatī as Buddha Amitabha. ... Dharmākara may 
be an actual monk of this tradition who systematized and wrote 
down the cult and doctrine of Amitabha.
Transcendence leads to change of nomenclature. Šākyamuni 
was flanked by Brahma and Sakra. But when Sakyamuni became 
Amitabha, the attendant acolytes changed names: Brahmā became 
Avalokita-svara and Sakra became Mahasthāmaprāpta. Brahmā 
envisions the mantras and as the upholder of the vision enshrined 
in mantras He holds the Four Vedas in His hands. He is the supre- 
me symbol of brahma-ghoșa, the revealed Word of mantras. In 
the new terminology He was Avalokita « seer » + of svara << Word, 
Logos ». We have already noted that the form Avalokita-svara is 
actually found in Central Asian manuscripts. The Chinese Kuan-yin 
and Japanese Kannon is Kuan/kan « see » + yin/on « sound », a 
translation of Avalokita-svara. Sakra means « The Powerful One » 
from the root sak « to be powerful », and so does mahā << great » + 
sthāma « power, stamina » + prāpta « attained >>.
Sakra/Indra becomes Mahasthamaprāpta. The metamorphosis 
of Sakra/Indra to Mahasthāmaprāpta goes back to his earliest cha- 
racterization in the Ṛgveda. Sakra is from the root sak, from which 
is derived sakti « power ». Both Sakra and Mahāsthāmaprāpta sym-

bolize might. Indra wields the vajra and it exhilerates him to carry 
out his warlike deeds (Macdonell 56). The gigantic size and fierce 
might of Indra is dwelt upon in many passages of the Ṛgveda: 
<< When Indra grasped the two boundless worlds, they were but a 
handful to him (RV.3.30.5). ...His greatness and power are lauded 
in the most unstinted terms. ...No one, god or man, either 
surpasses 
or equals him (RV.6.30.4). Neither former, later, nor recent beings 
have attained to his valour (RV.5.42.6). Neither gods nor men nor 
waters have attained to the limit of his might (RV.1.100.15). ...All 
the gods yield to him in might and strength (RV.8.51.7). Even the 
former gods subordinated their powers to his divine glory and 
kingly dignity (RV.7.21.7). All the gods are unable to frustrate his 
deeds and counsels (RV.2.32.4)» (Macdonell 57-58). «Indra, the 
wielder of the thunderbolt, who destroys the aerial demons in bat- 
tle, is constantly invoked by warriors » (Macdonell 62). << Regarded 
as a whole the attributes of Indra are chiefly those of physical 
superiority and of dominion over the physical world. Energetic ac- 
tion is characteristic of him, while passive sway is distinctive of 
Varuna. Indra is a universal monarch, not as the applier of the 
eternal laws of the universe nor as a moral ruler, but as an irresist- 
ible warrior whose mighty arm wins victory » (Macdonell 64). In 
continuation of the Vedic tradition, he was rightly termed one who 
has attained (prāpta) mighty (maha) prowess (sthama). The new 
name celebrated the main attribute of Indra, namely, dominating 
superiority and energetic action.
The Pāli Dhammapad-atthakatha 4.105f. mentions Indra as a 
giver of punishment to guilty people with his thunderbolt (Inda- 
vajira, Haldar 1977:84). « In the fourteenth Sutta of Samyutta- 
nikāya, Sakka explains how new gods, who outshine the old ones, 
do so because they observe the Buddha's teachings » (Haldar 1977: 
85). He is spoken of as the lord of victors in Jātakas 5.322 (jayatam 
pati), and he is the embodiment of the greatest valour (Mahāvaṁsa 
30.10). He is called Vajira-hattha in the Digha-nikāya 2.259. The 
sound of Indra's thunderbolt striking its victim, surpasses all 
other sounds by its intensity, its volume and its fearfulness no ob- 
struction can stop the progress of Indra's Vajira and it never mis- 
ses its mark (Malalasekera 1937:1.309-310). Mahasthāmaprāpta con-

198Lokesh Chandra
tinues to hold the vajra in his hand. Later on he developed into 
Vajrapāņi and Akāśagarbha. Buddhaghosa tells us that Vajrapāņi 
is the same as Sakka (A.K. Coomaraswamy, Yakṣas, p. 30).
Brahma becomes A. Brahma, the other adorant of the pair, 
was renamed Avalokita-svara and he held a lotus in his hand. Brah- 
mā represents brahman the sacred word. He is Vagiśvara (Liebert 
1976:46). He envisions the mantras (mantra-draṣṭā). In the Amita- 
yurdhyāna-sūtra A. is the great vidyadhipati, and he is in possession 
of hundreds of mantras: aneka-mantra-satā-'vakīrṇa (E.B.2.259b). 
Svara, the second member of the compound of Avalokita-svara 
rightly characterizes him. The association of Brahma with brahma- 
ghosa or the Vedas needs no detailing. The Vedas, envisaged as 
the Eternal-Law (Dharma), the scheme of the universe, spring from 
Brahma and return into him. Brahma is also the Great Lord of 
Speech (Brhas-pati), the First-Seer (Adi-kavi) (Daniélou 1964:234, 
235). In his four hands he can hold the four Vedas. Brahma-svara 
is the name of a former Buddha in the Mahāvastu 3.231.11f. In 
Samādhirāja 57.7f. the names of two former Buddhas are Brahme- 
śvara.
Just as Brahma is Caturänana or Caturmukha « Four-faced >> 
(Amarakośa 1.1.16-18) so is Avalokita-svara. The 24th chapter of the 
Saddharma-punḍarika-sutra calls him Samantamukha or facing all 
the four directions. The Rupa-manḍana says that the four faces of 
Brahma represent the four Vedas: Rgveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda 
and Atharvaveda (Ṛgvedadi-prabhedena...catur-vaktram caturbhu- 
jam).
Brahma is born of the lotus: he is Abja-ja, Abja-yoni, Kamala- 
yoni, Kañ-ja, Kañja-ja, Sarojin (Liebert 1976:46). Avalokita-svara 
prominently sports the lotus in his hand, in keeping with his ori- 
ginator Brahmā.
Brahma holds a water-gourd (Brahma kamandalu-dharaḥ kar- 
tavyaḥ sa caturmukhaḥ, Matsya-purana 259.40). Avalokita-svara with 
a vase abounds in Japanese iconography, for example, the A. at 
Dōmyōji monastery at Osaka (Yoshiaki 1969:fig.80). The earliest 
wooden sculptures of A. with vase are the Kudara Kannon and 
Kumen Kannon in the Daihōzōden Repository of the Hōryūji mo- 
nastery (Kuno 1966: fig. 57, 58 and 60).

The Origin of Avalokita-svara / Avalokit-eśvara199
Brahma Sahārpati is the lord of the earth (saha). He is Lokeśa 
in the Amarakośa 1.1.16. Avalokita-svara too is Loka-nātha and 
Lokeśvara. The ideograph shih»world, loka » in the Chinese
translations reflects this fundamental characteristic of A.
It is clear that Brahma was transcreated into Avalokita-svara. 
In the earliest periods, the Chinese renderings of the term show 
yin 音 = svara. The original and correct term therefore is Avalo- 
kita-svara, preserved in Chinese Kuan-[shih-]yin = Japanese Kan- 
[ze-]on to this day. Avalokitesvara was a later hyper-Sanskritiza- 
tion, when the underlying meaning of the term had been lost.
The earliest and superb masterpiece painting of Amitabha with 
Mahāsthāmaprāpta to the right and A. to the left is the mural done 
on Wall 6 of the Golden Hall (Kondo) of the Hōryūji monastery in 
the seventh century.
Preeminence of A. The Bodhisattvas are not equal among them- 
selves. In the « heaven of Amitabha there are two, Avalokita and 
Mahasthāmaprāpta, almost as great and luminous as Buddha, who 
sit on thrones equal to his. Avalokita is the more majestic; this is 
due to his vow to bring all beings, without exception, into the 
«happy land ». And while his glorious body illumines a great many 
worlds, he traverses them all in different forms, sometimes real 
and sometimes magical; like Amitabha himself, he has parts of 
himself incarnated here and there; he never forgets for a moment 
his role as provider of the Sukhāvatī » (Poussin 1909: ERE.2.258b). 
Avalokita-svara is called Sukhāvatīśvara in the lexicon Trikāṇḍa- 
seșa. The predominance of Avalokita-svara over Mahāsthāmaprāpta 
can also be explained by his antecedent deity. Like Avalokita-svara, 
his origin Brahma Sahāmpati was a mighty and powerful Mahā- 
brahma (Samyutta-nikaya 5.410 quoted in Malalasekera 1960:338). 
A. became an independent deity and gained perennial popularity 
that has continued to our day. His wide vogue led to the incorpora- 
tion of a number of other deities into His many forms, like Nila- 
kantha Lokeśvara with or without a thousand arms.
Further transformations. The transformation of Indra into 
Mahāsthāmaprāpta, and of Brahma into Avalokita-svara, continued 
to evolve into new deities. Two new pairs developed:

200Lokesh Chandra
IndraBrahmā
MahāsthāmaprāptaAvalokita-svara
VajrapāņiPadmapāņi
ĀkāśagarbhaKṣitigarbha
The pair of Vajrapāņi and Padmapāņi symbolize the attributes held 
in the hands, while Akāśagarbha and Kṣitigarbha stress the spatial 
dominions of Heaven (ākāśa) and Earth (kṣiti) of the pair. In the 
Garbhadhātu mandala of the eighth century Vajrapāņi and Padma- 
pāņi flank Vairocana. So do they stand to the right and left of 
Vairocana the central deity of the eighth century Candi Mendut at 
Yogyakarta (Indonesia). The Sang Hyang Kamahāyānikan (10th 
cent.) speaks of Sakyamuni flanked by Lokeśvara on the right and 
Vajrapāņi on the left. Lokeśvara is of red colour and in dhyana- 
mudrā. Vajrapāņi is blue and in bhūḥsparśa-mudrā (p. 60). The 
trinity is equated as follows:
tattva (p. 63)triratna (p. 64)
Śākyamuni arthaBuddha
Lokeśvarakāmadharma
Vajrapāņisabdasangha
In the Lha-khan of the Lotsava, attributed by tradition to Rin-chen- 
bzan-po (A. D. 958-1055), remain great stucco statues of Śākyamuni 
seated in the middle, Maitreya and Mañjuśrī, Padmapāņi and Vaj- 
rapāņi standing at his two sides (Tucci & Ghersi 1935:183). These 
go back to the early times of the Buddhist revival in the land of 
Guge. Thus we can discern several transformations of the original 
pair of Indra and Brahma flanking Lord Buddha.

THE PUBLISHED WORKS OF DR. LOKESH CHANDRA
Prof. Lokesh Chandra
J 22 Hauz Khas Enclave 
New Delhi 110016
March 1980

3
The epic of man's march over the centuries, in remote grasslands, 
lands of ice, expanses of sand and vales of magic charm -is
chronicled in 284 large and learned volumes of the published work 
of Dr. Lokesh Chandra. His researches make us alive to the immensity 
of ideas in the vastness of time, and at the same moment they betoken 
a vibrant hope of a dynamic future in an ever-evolving time-space 
continuum.
The annals, texts, pantheonic scrolls, cosmographic mandalas, 
annotated and evaluated by Dr. Lokesh Chandra are laden with rich 
treasures of art, philosophy, sciences, literature and all else that 
sheds effulgence on ages when India's sages and savants toasted with 
the Hordes that raced from the shores of the Amur and the Baikal to 
the shores of the Volga and the Caspian; the ages when the Hun, the 
Uigur, the Tokhar, the Scythian, the Sogdian, the Kuchean, the Agnian, 
the Mongol and the Manchu had paid homage to ageless wisdom, the ages 
when ācāryas had dawned serenity into lands that lie in the lap of 
the Himalayas and beyond, or when their boats braved the perils of 
the sea to the southeastern climes.
The oeuvre of Dr. Lokesh Chandra enchants while it illumines the 
dark, dateless and undefined unknown. You can get lost in travels 
with Dr. Lokesh Chandra into the spacious majesty of Angkor Vat, where 
monument follows on monument, ruins edge upon ruins, the walls of 
vegetation screen and hide and curtain, masonry masses mingle into

4.
the fantastic flowering of the jungle. The shrines seem to have 
been transported by divine magic straight from India. By moonlight 
these buildings take on an appearance of solid majesty which is 
awe-inspiring. In the twilight gloom of these jungles a någa 
slithers over the sensuous limbs of an apsara petrified in a 
seductive pose of her dance in honor of a Devaraja of lost Angkor. 
The writings of Dr. Lokesh Chandra span several languages of 
Asia wherein he discusses with critical acumen finer points of 
Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, Tibetan, Indonesian, 
Persian, Arabic in intercultural contexts.
The work of Dr. Lokesh Chandra has revolutioned the understanding 
of the evolution of several countries of Asia as he has opened up 
unknown texts, facts and evaluations, tempting the scientific world 
to the light that keeps vigil on the far horizon, deep in history. 
The timeless toil of Dr. Lokesh Chandra transcends exigencies and 
circumstances into the web of abiding international understanding. 
He has attended several international conferences and travelled 
extensively in remote corners of the world in search of frozen 
levels of culture pulsating in the warm reality of life.

century. Professors Oertel and Caland had even published ex- 
tensive extracts, but it was not found possible to edit the text 
as a whole. With the discovery of new manuscripts after a long 
and arduous search in Jaiminiya families, it has been possible 
to bring out a complete text. In importance it rivals the Sata- 
patha Brahmana.

of the Karmapas.

9
35.Mkhas-pahi-dgah-ston, Part 3. It completes the chapter on 
Karmapas, and chronicles the Ḥbri-khun bkah-rgyud and other

photomechanically.The accuracy of details and the authenticity
of its quotations have been attested by originals.It is a
most reliable source for a better comprehension of the vital 
Council of Samye, which laid the foundation of Tibetan Buddhism. 
37.The Samye Monastery. Samye is known as one of the most ancient 
temples of Tibet, where the edict of King Khri-sron-lde-btsan 
establishing Buddhism as the state religion was promulgated. 
Samye is the earliest monastic complex of Tibet, built as a 
great mandala symbolizing her entry into a new cosmic order.

it deals with a specific area it opens before us a new genre of

10
Tibetan literature.

bibliographical work Dpe-rgun-dkon-pa-hgah-zhig-gi-tho-yig of 
Akhu Rimpoche Ses-rab-rgya-mtsho (1803-1875), which is very

The Three Hundred Icons of Tibet. Reproduction of a Peking 
59.
xylograph which is referred to as sku-brian brgya-phrag-gsum 
(f. 2b) and sku-brñan sum-brgya (f. 8b) in the preface. The preface 
was written by the famous Lean-skya Incarnate Rol-pahi-rdo-rje
or Lalitavajra who was the Imperial Preceptor to Emperor 
Ch'ien-lung. Lalitavajra lived from 1717 to 1786 A.D., and so 
this Pantheon is to be dated in the 18th century.
1965
60-61. A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, Parts 10,11 reproduce 340 
remarkable rubbings of Arhats from the Lung-ch'uan ssu or 
"Dragon-spring Monastery" obtained from a monastery in Mukden 
(Manchuria). Its simple strong lines marking the folds of 
garments are in contrast to the powerful rendition of the visage 
against a void background.
62The Amarakosa in Tibet, being a new Tibetan version by the great 
grammarian of Situ in the 17th century. It is far superior to 
the canonical translation of Yar-luns lotsava. The facsimile 
edition is preceded by a detailed introduction of 56 pages. 
Amarakosa and other Sanskrit lexicons inspired a sizeable genre 
of Tibetan lexicons. The Mñon-brjod Mkhas-paḥi rna-rgyan is 
one of the most widely used. It is also reproduced in facsimile 
in this edition.
Sanskrit Bias and Mantras in Japan, reproduces the rich heritage 63.
of bijas, varnapatha, and entire mantras written in Siddham 
script in the perfection of their calligraphic art by eminences 
of Japan's cultural evolution, like Kōbō daishi (774-835 A.D.),

13
Chisho daishi (814-891), Hui-kuo (746-805), Denkyō daishi
(767-822), and several others. In the preface all the Siddham
graffiti are transcribed and dated.
64-67. The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Parts 1-4. Bu-ston (1290- 
1364 A.D.) is of the greatest representatives of Tibetan 
thought; there is scarcely a branch of the sacred disciplines 
that he did not cultivate, and the entire spiritual tradition 
which was transmitted to Tibet was systematically arranged, 
discussed and sifted by him. He covered the entire field of 
Buddhism, from tantrism to logic, from dogmatics proper to 
grammar and rhetoric. Some of his works are important for the 
history of Lamaist art and iconography: the same is true of 
him in every other field.
1966
68-69. The Kalacakra-tantra and other Texts, Parts 1,2. It comprises, 
interalia, the fundamental Kalacakra-tantra in Sanskrit, Tibetan 
and Mongolian. The Sanskrit text is based on two Nepalese 
manuscripts, one of which is dated 1446 A.D. It is in grand 
format of 28 cm. x 30 cm. It is the basic text of the vast 
Kalacakra literature in Tibetan and Mongolian.
70-73. Sanskrit Texts from the Imperial Palace at Peking, Parts 1-4. 
It is an encyclopaedic quadrilingual collection of Sanskrit 
dharani-mantras in four languages in an intentional sequence 
of: Manchu the language of the Emperor, Chinese the language 
of the Empire, Mongol the language of the Imperial Preceptor 
and editor of the work, and Tibetan the language of Dharma,

14
The mantras are in transcription. The collection was compiled 
by the Imperial Preceptor Lalitavajra during the reign of 
Emperor Ch'ien-lung in 1759 A.D., and xylographed in 1773 on 
the 80th birthday of the Emperor's Mother. This collection
of dharani-mantras reproduced here points to a fascinating 
investigation into the role of the Emperor's Mother, during 
the long reign of her great son Ch'ien-lung, in the 
efflorescence of the cultural trinity of art, literature, and 
architecture, emanating the three planes of kaya, vak and citta. 
74.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 5. It brings to a close 
the fundamental works of Bu-ston on Kalacakra literature. It
comprises studies on the stotra, mandala, sadhana, homa and 
other rites which were described in the Larger Mula Kalacakra, 
which is not extant now.
75.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 6. It contains the 
exegesis of the Laghu Saivara-tantra in 700 granthas, derived 
from the now-lost stupendous Mula-tantra in 300,000 granthas.
1967
76.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 7, with a Foreword by 
H.H. the Dalai Lama. It continues to deal with the Samvara 
cycle: its sadhana, mandala, homa, technical terms, abhiṣeka, 
pūjā, abhisamaya, etc.
77A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, Part 12. It depicts the 26 
mandalas of the Vajravali as detailed in the Nișpannayogavali 
of Abhayakaragupta, a teacher at the Nalanda University. These 
are supplemented by eight more mandalas. The Preface (pages

15
1-80) identifies each and every deity in the mandalas with the 
help of charts. The structural analysis and index afford a
key to the unravelling of the deigraphic complexes in art and 
architecture.
78-80. A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, Parts 13-15 illustrate 132
mandalas pertaining to all the classes of tantras, namely the 
kriya, carya, yoga, anuttarayoga, advaya, and amnāta tantras. 
The original thankas come from the Monastery of Nor, a subsect 
of the Sakyapas. It is the first time that this rare series 
has been illustrated completely, providing an abundance of 
iconographic data, leading to a deeper appreciation of the art 
heritage of India, Tibet, and Mongolia.
81.A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, Part 16 illustrates new icons 
from the Lhasa xylograph of the Bhadrakal pika-sutra, ending 
with the Eight Great Caityas. From the Astasahasrika pantheon 
are illustrated the Twelve Buddhas, Mahasiddhas, Eight 
Vidyadharas, Teachers of the Lam-rim tradition, and eminent
gurus.
82.A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon, Part 17 depicts the lines of 
transmission of tantric texts. It begins with the Guhyasamāja 
which stands at the head of the anuttara tantras. The presiding 
deities and teachers of the Samvara, Bhairava, Cakras amvara 
Heruka, Bhaiṣajyaguru traditions appear in print for the first 
time.

report of the first Indian Cultural Delegation to the Buryat 
ASSR., presented on the occasion of the XXVII International

85.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 8 begins with a sub- 
commentary on the scholium of Hevajra-tantra by Grags-pa-rgyal- 
mtshan of the Sa-skya-pa sect. It is followed by a short 
analysis and detailed commentary on the Samputa-tantra and 
three shorter treatises connected therewith.
86.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 9 comprises four exegetical 
works on the Guhyasamaja, which represents the Mahayoga upaya 
class of tantras.
87.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 10 continues the exegesis 
of the Guhyasamāja-tantra. Mandala, stotra, homa, sadhana, 
adhisthana, mystic dance, pañcakrama and balividhi of 
Guhyasamaja form a rich contribution to its literature.From
p. 349 onwards we find works on the Vajrapani group of Anuttara 
yoga tantras. It is followed by texts on various rites of the 
Yamari group of tantras 1its abhisamaya, mandala, bali,homa,
yantra and pūjā.

of his expedition.
99The .Autobiography and Diaries of Si-tu Pan-chen. It is one of 
the most important sources for the intellectual history of the 
18th century Lamaist world. Situ's life-long interest was 
silpasastra, the techniques of painting and casting, grammatic

19
sciences, history, astronomy and astrology.Situ's careful 
scholarship is attested by the enormous task of editing and
correcting the Derge edition of the Kanjur in 1731-33. His
work throws light on the history of Nepal, where he was
received by king Jagajjayamalla of Kathmandu (1722-1736). It 
is an unusual Tibetan historical document.
100.A 15th Century Tibetan Compendium of Knowledge. It outlines 
the physical world, sentient creatures, royal lineages, tribal 
structure of the world, eighteen lands of Jambudvipa, the 
geographical divisions of Tibet, the myriarchies of Central

importance of rhetoric and public speaking, types of songs, etc. 
101.The Life of the Saint of Gtsan. Gtsan-smyon (1452-1507) is the 
most significant of the well known smyon-pa, a phenomenon in 
reform and innovation. His 12-volume collection of Shan-brgyud 
is a signal contribution to Tibetan literature. His biography 
in the present volume is reproduced from 16th century blocks 
(1547 A.D.)
102. The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 14 describes vidhis of the 
mandalas of Navosnisa, Mrtyunjaya, Vajrapani, Akṣobhya, 
Dharmadhatu-vägisvara, Vairocana bhisambodhi, Rasmi-vimala, 
Amoghapasa, etc; and summarfes MañjuśrIkirti's commentary on 
the Namasangiti. It is basic for the understanding of mandalas. 
At the end (pp. 843-1013) is a treatise on the classification 
of tantras.

20
103.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 15 elaborates the 
characteristics of the four-fold classification of the tantras 
and their further subdivisions. In fact, the whole volume is 
devoted to this very topic and comprises only two titles, one
of extensive (pp. 1-610) and the other of medium length (pp. 611- 
913).
104. The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 16 gives the genealogies 
of the transmission of various schools of tantras besides 
mantras to 355 divinities, culled from different tantras. ALL 
the mantras are in Sanskrit and thus they constitute interesting 
Sanskrit texts from Tibet.
105.The Collected Works of Bu-ston, Part 17 is a rich source of 
information on the mural art of Tibet. It describes at length 
the paintings that adorned the walls of different buildings at 
the Zha-lu monastery in Western Tibet where Bu-ston lived and 
which was the seat of his life work. The descriptions of 
mandalas of different classes of tantras (namely, yoga, carya 
and kriya) add to better comprehension of the cosmics of Indo- 
Tibetan expression.

history of the Esoteric Art of Japan.
1972
Facsimile 122-123. Sanskrit Manuscripts from Japan, vols. 1,2. 
edition of 55 Sanskrit manuscripts written in the Siddham 
script. These manuscripts belong to the Shing on tradition of 
Mantrayana which was introduced into Japan in 806 by Kobo Daishi.

24
In the last century Prof. Max Müller had obtained and published 
a few Sanskrit texts from Japan.Thereafter no scholar
undertook to search out Sanskrit manuscripts in Japan; hence
the historic significance of the present discovery.
1973
124. Buryat Annotations on the Lam-rim, is a rare exegesis on the 
system of Graduated Path' of Buddhist insight, experience 
and realisation introduced into Tibet by Atisa Dipankaraśrījñāna 
in the 11th century. The work of AtIsa was restructured by 
Tsonkhapa in his Lam-rim chen-mo which is profoundly abstruse. 
It was commented upon by the first Panchen Lama (1567?-1662). 
The present work is a collection of notes on it made by Ses- 
rab-rgya-mtsho in 1908 in a Siberian monastery. 
125.Buddha in Chinese Woodcuts reproduces the woodprinted Shih- 
chia ju-lai ying-hua shih-chi, a Chinese biography of Lord 
Buddha. The meaning of the title is: 'Deeds of Sakyamuni the 
transformation-body of Tathāgata'. The illustrated biography 
was xylographed in 1787-1793 under the patronage of the Manchu 
Prince Yung-shan, a great grand-child of Emperor K'ang-hsi who 
ruled from A.D. 1661 to 1722. It was based on an earlier work 
of the Ming Period (A.D. 1368-1664). The biography comprises 
quotations and illustrations on opposite pages. It runs into 
200 pages: with 100 pages of full-size woodcut illustrations 
of important episodes in the life of Lord Buddha and the spread 
of his Dharma.
126.Collected Works of Longdol Lama. Longdol Lama Nag-dbah-blo-bzan

25
lived in the 18th century and dealt with a variety of
disciplines.The information or elucidations given by him 
are not available anywhere. His collected works form a
thesaurus of the richesse of Buddhist philosophy, technical 
terms of mantrayana, Kalacakra, architecture (of the 
Dhanyakaṭaka stupa), transcendental philosophy of the 
Prajñāpāramitā, logic, grammar, kavya, metrics, lexicography, 
explanations of scientific terms in technological, medical, 
astrological and astronomical works. The thob-yig provides 
invaluable materials for the development of art and philosophy. 
On pages 1150-1214 are given the genealogies of eminent scholars 
of India and Tibet. Pages 1458-1463 deal with methods to test 
jewels.
127-136. Mongolian Kanjur, vols. 1-10. The 108 volumes of the
Mongolian Kanjur symbolise the cultural symphony of India and 
Mongolia over the centuries, embodying the Mongolian versions 
of 1161 Sanskrit works, most of which have perished in India. 
"There are more than six thousand Sanskrit texts preserved in 
the Mongolian language, ranging from Panini's grammar, Amarakosa, 
Kalidasa's works, Ayurvedic treatises, to Bodhicaryāvaṭāra. 
The Mongolian people regard these Sanskrit works as the 'pearl 
of their literature'." The American Mongolist Dr. Stanley Frye 
wrote: "I wish to congratulate you on the wonderful work you 
have done. As I wrote you previously, this edition of the 
Kanjur now being made available to scholars all over the world 
is certainly the greatest contribution to Buddhist studies of 
this century. Buddhist scholars will be grateful to you for

26
centuries to come."
1974
137-141. Gilgit Buddhist Manuscripts, vols, 6-10 reproduce the lost 
Sanskrit texts of the Vinayavastu, Mahapratisarā, Ratnaketu- 
sutra, Avadana texts which are a mine for the evolution of 
Sanskrit prose, Bhaiṣajya-guru-sutra, Samadhi-raja, Saddharma- 
pundarika-sutra (or Lotus Sutra) and several other works which 
became the foundation of the vast Buddhist literary heritage 
of the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Tibetan, Mongolian and 
Indonesian peoples. Their relevance for Asian culture is unique. 
142,143. Sadhanamala of the Panchen Lama, vols. 1,2. Reproduction of 
the Rin-lhan of the Panchen Lama Bstan-paḥi-ni-ma-phyogs-las- 
rnam-rgyal (1781-1852). This voluminous work is a source for 
Transhimalayan pantheonic albums. It puts their apparent 
amorphousness into a well-knit structure, inspiring their 
delineations with life. It affords a deeper understanding of 
the meditational contexts which gave rise to the scintillating 
world of Vajrayana art.
144.The Blue Annals (Deb-ther-snon-po) were completed by Ḥgos 
lotsava Gzhon-nu-dpal in A.D. 1478. Ever since, it has been a 
fundamental work on the history of Buddhism in Tibet, extensively 
cited by Tibetan historians and modern European scholars. Its
English translation by George Roerich published in 1949 and 
1953 has further rendered it indispensable for several Asian 
disciplines.

159-167. Collected Works of Sum-pa-mkhan-po Ye-ses-dpal-hbyor 
(17 04-1788) include his well-known history of Buddhism in 
India, Tibet, China and Mongolia. "Sum-pa-mkhan-po was one 
of the outstanding scholars of the Lamaist world, a man of 
great learning and one with a critical mind. The study of his 
works is indispensable for a better knowledge of Lamaist 
scholarship in the eighteenth century". (J.W. de Jong). 
Reproduced from xylographs obtained from the Üsütü-yin sume 
monastery of Koke-khota the capital of Inner Mongolia. The 
present edition will help to understand history, geography, 
philosophy, scapulomancy, medicine and other disciplines of 
18th century Transhimalaya,
168.Sudhana's Way to Enlightenment. It reproduces two Chinese 
works on the pilgrimage of Sudhana throughout India, to 52 
teachers in search of Supreme Enlightenment. The depiction of
this spiritual journey of Sudhana was the prime expression of 
the Avatamsaka School and enjoyed wide-spread popularity from 
Indonesia to Khotan in Central Asia, China and Japan. The 
earliest representations are the Indonesian reliefs on the 
Borobudur (about A.D.800). The present work reproduces Fo- 
kuo's work entitled Wên-shu chih-nan t'u-tsan "pictures and 
eulogies of (Sudhana's journey) in accordance with the guidance 
of Mañjuśri". He wrote this work around A.D. 1101. It is the 
earliest surviving illustrated Chinese work on the Ganda-vyuha 
and an outstanding specimen of the developed technique of

170-172. The Ocean Annals of Amdo, vols. 1-3. The Deb-ther rgya- 
mtsho or Amdo chojung reproduced from the original xylographs 
obtained in Siberia, It was written by the Zhabs-drun of the 
Labrang monastery in 1833, enlarged in 1849 and supplemented 
in 1865. It is a general history of Buddhism in Amdo from the 
earliest times and comprises detailed annals of monasteries on 
northern and southern sides of the Rma-chu river.
173. Mañjusri-nama-sangīti, Sanskrit text in Soyombo and Tibetan 
transcription and Tibetan translation. Reproduced from a 
Siberian xylograph. It is the only known instance of a Sanskrit 
text in Soyombo script which was created on the basis of
Devanagari in the 17th century by the Jibcundampa of the Mongols. 
174-180. Mongolian Kanjur, vols. 25-31 comprise texts nos. 745-751.
1976
181-194. Sanskrit Texts from the Imperial Palace at Peking, vols. 9-22: 
a quadri-lingual encyclopaedia of Sanskrit dharani-mantras 
compiled by Lean-skya qutur-tu Rol-pahi-rdo-rje (1717-1786) 
the illustrious preceptor of the Manchu Emperor Chien-lung. 
The mantras are transcribed in Manchu, Chinese, Mongolian, and

29
Tibetan. This collection provides a mine of information to 
evaluate and verify the reconstruction of early Chinese 
phonology worked out from other sources. It can afford an 
approximate phonetic value of ideographs in various periods 
of Chinese speech, in the context of their correct Sanskrit 
pronunciation being known.
The Dharani-collection can be worked into a corpus of 
fragments of lost Sanskrit texts, which will aid critical 
editions of Sanskrit citations in Central-Asian, Tibetan, 
Mongolian, Sino-Japanese, Indonesian and other literatures 
of Asia.
195.Kashgar Manuscript of the Sadharma-pundarika-sutra, is one of 
the earliest complete Sanskrit texts to be discovered from 
the sands of Central Asia. Prof. Heinz Bechert hails it in 
the following words: "The publication of a facsimile edition 
of the famous Kashgar manuscript of Saddharma-pundarika is a 
most important event in the history of Buddhist studies as 
well as of Indology. Professor Lokesh Chandra deserves high 
praise for his continuous efforts which have resulted in the 
publication of this book. The Lotus Sutra i.e. the Saddharma- 
pundarika needs no introduction. It is, together with the 
Bhagavad Gita, the New Testament and the Koran, one of the 
greatest books of the religious history of mankind." 
196.Bodhicaryavatara (i) pre-Canonical Mongolian text and (ii) 
Tibeto-Mongolian commentary by Blo-bzan-dpal-ldan. It is the 
earliest known complete text of the great didactic work of 
Santideva. It is very close to the 16th century fragments

204. Buddhist Philosophical Systems. It is a reproduction of the 
Grub-mthah by the Second Lean-skya qutuɣtu Rol-pahi-rdo-rje, 
who lived from 1717 to 1786. He was a close confidant of the 
Emperor Ch'ien-lung (1735-1796) with whom he had studied. 
1745 Lcan-skya bestowed upon the Emperor the tantric initiation 
of Cakrasamvara. During the period between 1736 and 1746 
Lean-skya began writing his philosophical masterpiece, the 
present Grub-mthahi rnam-par-bzhag-pa gsal-bar bśad-pa thub- 
bstan lhun-pohi mdzes-rgyan. The initial stimulus was perhaps 
his interest in vijñanavada philosophical traditions preserved 
by the Chinese Buddhist schools. The present reproduction is 
of inestimable value for the understanding of Buddhist philosophy.

208. Vairavali, facsimile edition. It was written by Abhayākara- 
gupta in the twelfth century. He was the abbot of Vikramasila 
during the reign of Pala king Ramapala (1084-1130). Tibetan 
scholars risked the hazards of perilous journeys to study under 
him. The VajravalI was translated into Tibetan by Hkhor-lo- 
grags under the guidance of the author himself. It is a prime 
text in Tibet and Mongolia for the ritual and painting of 
mandalas on scrolls.
209-218. Mongolian Kanjur, vols. 39-48. Comprises texts bearing the 
consecutive numbers 759-796. Some of the texts are very long, 
for instance, the Pañca-vinsati-sahasrika Prajñāpāramitā

cultural literary developments.
251-281. Mongolian Kanjur,
vols.78-108 comprise texts numbered
consecutively from 957-1161. It completes the Mongolian 
Buddhist Tripitaka. These works are implicit with deep meaning 
for India and many other countries, supplying historic evidence

manifold strands today lie disseminated far apart. It will 
usher in a new order in the academic world wherein precision 
will replace over-generalisation.

und unermeßlichen Nutzen dadurch gewonnen. Wie kann man nur den
Göttern dienen mit dieser Gesinnung 33 !"
T'ao Hsü bemerkt dazu:
Die Hua-yen-Schule spricht äußerst viel von der Natur und von den 
wichtigsten Grundsätzen der Mahayana-Schule: Die drei Einsichten strahlen 
aus bis ins Unendliche, die zehn philosophischen Grundgedanken sind voll- 
ständig enthalten in jeder Haarspitze, und jedes Staubkorn enthält die 
Dharma-Elemente. Es gibt keine Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Größe. Die 
Weitsicht des Buddha und die zehntausend verschiedenen Formelemente 
des Universums sind in dem kleinsten Lichtpunkt enthalten. Das ist die 
unfaßbare große Wahrheit Buddhas. Die wesenhaften Prinzipien durch- 
dringen alles vollständig. Warum sollten sich die Buddhisten vor allem ab- 
sperren? I-ch'uan weiß, daß die zehntausend Prinzipien sich auf ein Prinzip 
zurückführen lassen. Aber er weiß nicht, daß ein Prinzip sich ausdehnt auf 
Zehntausende von Dingen, sich bis ins Unendliche wiederholend. Das eigene 
Selbst und das Andere sind ungetrennt im kleinsten Staubkörnchen, immer 
sind sie beieinander auch im kleinsten Bruchteil des Gedankens. Bis zu den 
verborgensten Feinheiten stößt die Lehre vor. Ein Laienpriester des Hina- 
yana kann davon nichts wissen. Dabei sind die Fähigkeiten der buddhisti- 
schen Philosophen vollkommen. Nur alle jene Häretiker und Himmels- 
teufel (Māras) wollen das Nirvāņa unterschlagen. Die ewige Wiederkehr 
von Leben und Tod ist lediglich eine leere Vorstellung. Himmel und Hölle 
sind beide geheiligtes Land. Wenn gesagt wird, die Buddhisten seien selbst- 
süchtig aus Furcht vor der ewigen Wiederkehr von Leben und Tod, so ist 
das ein großer Irrtum. Die Bodhisattvas des Mahāyāna scheuen keine barm- 
herzigen Taten für die anderen. Sie wollen alle ins Leben zurücktreten und 
wieder in den Tod gehen, um die anderen Lebewesen zur Erleuchtung zu 
führen. Obwohl sie sich in der bösen Welt von Leben und Tod befinden, 
benehmen sie sich, als gingen sie in einem Garten spazieren. Außerdem 
wurde gesagt: Die Buddhisten sind geschickt darin, Ausflüchte zu machen. 
Wenn sie aber Ausflüchte machen wollen, warum sollen sie sie dann noch 
in Bücher schreiben? Sie machen absolut keine Ausflüchte. Dann zieht 
I-ch'uan noch eine so oberflächliche und kleinliche Sache wie das Anstecken 
einer Räucherkerze heran, um die buddhistischen Heiligen zu verunglimp- 
fen. Wenn er von der Bedeutung der drei Einsichten der Hua-yen-Schule 
hörte, dann würde er auf keinen Fall so etwas sagen. Wenn er von 
der Einsicht ausginge, daß jedes Ding das andere ohne Widerstand durch- 
dringt, so könnte er kaum behaupten, daß man nur eine Weihrauchkerze 
anzuzünden brauche, um unermeßliches Glück und unermeßlichen Vorteil 
zu erlangen. (Das Verhältnis zwischen Kerze und unermeßlichem Glück ist 
zu ungleich.) Sogar ein kleines Staubkörnchen kann im Lichte der Buddha- 
Wahrheit unermeßliche Verdienste haben. Davon hat I-ch'uan aber viel- 
leicht nie gehört. Man braucht sich deshalb nicht zu wundern.-
Soweit geht die Auseinandersetzung mit Ch'eng I. Erst im dritten Teil 
wendet sich T'ao Hsü gegen Chu Hsi selbst.

The Rin-lhan and Rin-ḥbyun
To the Memory of Professor F. D. Lessing,
By Lokesh Chandra
(New Delhi)
An iconographie compendium, shortly referred to as (R) by René de 
NEBESKY-WOJKOWITZ in his Oracles and Demons of Tibet, The Hague 1956, 
(in the following abbreviated as NW) was extensively used by him. Its full 
title is Yi-dam-rgya-mtshohi sgrub-thabs rin-chen-ḥbyun-gnas-kyi lhan-thabs 
rin-hbyun don gsal. It runs into two volumes with 519 and 470 folios 
respectively. Since the publication of the work of Nebesky-Wojkowitz, the 
author has been searching this xylograph. It was only last year (1960) 
that the author got access to it through the courtesy of Ta Lama Rnam- 
rgyal. It has proved to be of great interest for iconographic studies. The 
author has great pleasure in presenting a few introductory remarks about 
this fascinating work, as an humble tribute to Professor Dr. F. D. Lessing 
whose outstanding contributions to lamaistic iconography and ritual are 
well-known.
At the very outset it would be helpful to clarify the nomenclature of 
its title. Nebesky-Wojkowitz has called it Rin-hbyun. It is not only 
confusing, but also misleading. The margin of the xylograph has the short 
signature Rin-lhan. It is most appropriate as it distinguishes this work from 
its complement, the Rin-hbyun Snar-than brgya-rtsa Rdor-hphren bcas-nas 
gsuns-paḥi bris sku-mthon-ba don-ldan commonly referred to as the Five 
Hundred Gods of Narthang, which according to its marginal signature is 
the Rin-hbyun¹. Nebesky-Wojkowitz's juxtaposition of the Rin-hbyun proper 
and the Rin-lhan (under its wrong title Rin-hbyun) on p. 24 note 5 lead 
the author to find out if any interrelationship existed between the two 
and that has given rise to the present note.
To our joyous surprise, the Rin-lhan has turned out to be the original 
sadhana-collection which is illustrated in the Rin-hbyun. It is the first 
instance of its kind and a long-awaited opportunity when an ancient 
pantheon can be studied in its original sadhana-setting. Three other 
iconographic manuals are also known: the "Three Hundred Gods" of Lcan- 
skya Qutuytu Lalitavajra³, Chu Fo P'u-sa Shêng Hsiang Tsan [1] containing
1 It is described by Rev. F. A. PETER, "The Rin-hbyun", Journal Royal Asiatic 
Society of Bengal vol. IX (1943) pp. 1-27 (this article is full of errors).
2 "Since it [Rin-ḥbyun] is based on a written text, it is to be hoped that this, 
too, will one day be discovered and published" F. A. PETER, ibid., p. 13.

360 divinities ascribed to Lcan-skya Qutuytu, and the Pao-hsiang Lou
pantheon with 766 preserved images or inscribed pedestals -for none of 
them do we have the original text. The correlation of iconography and 
ritual will surely lead to a better comprehension of the complex details of 
the icons and their functional contexts.
The first volume of the Rin-lhan is continued in the second without a 
break in fact the 14th section begins in the first volume and continues 
in the second. The dkar-chag (or list of contents) gives serial numbers to 
the divinities or sets of divinities - these two are also continuous in the 
two volumes. The entire Rin-lhan is divided into 23 sections 5. They contain 
sadhanas of the following:
1. Ādikalyāṇa divinities",15. Sadhanas handed down by 
7Sākyarakṣita,
2. Vitarāga Tathāgatas,
3. Main divinities of the Mandala,16. Twenty-One Tārās according 
4. Vajravārāhī,to Suryagupta,
5. Avalokitesvara,17. Wealth-bestowing (dhanada) 
divinities,6. Tārā,
7. Vajrapāņi,18. Jñānanirmita (?) Mahākāla,
8. Hayagriva,19. Bhagavat Mahākāla,
9. Acala,
20. Remaining categories of 
10. Ayuḥsadhana divinities,Mahākāla,
11. Prajñā-bestowing divinities,21. Śrīdevi,
12. The Five Vajrasana-dhyāna (?) 22. Yama-yami Mahākāla and 
divinities,
allied divinities, and
13. Vaśamkaraṇa devis 8,
23. Paryavasāna-kalyāṇa 
14. Miscellaneous sadhanas,divinities 9.
It may be noted that the Rin-lhan begins with adikalyāņa divinities and 
ends with paryavasana-kalyāṇa ones.
Hereunder is the complete list of the Rin-lhan according to its dkar-chag. 
The serial number, Tibetan name of the divinity, recto verso and line 10 of 
the text are all from the dkar-chag, whose scientific precision is a marvel. 
The Sanskrit equivalents, followed by references to the Rin-hbyun, have 
been added.
4 For its description see W. E. CLARK, Two Lamaistic Pantheons, Cambridge 
Mass. 1937 (Harvard-Yenching Institute, Monograph Series, Vol. III), vol. I, introd. 
p. ix. Further on, it is referred to simply as CLARK.
5 The Chu Fo P'u-sa Shêng Hsiang Tsan is also divided into 23 divisions, for 
which see CLARK, introd. p. x. Is it a mere coincidence?

mentioned in the Hastapuja-vidhi (Sadhanamālā p. 498-500). Dpaḥ-mo 
is translated as Lakṣmi in Blue Annals p. 239. Sadhanamālā has 
"Vajravārāhim yogini-cakra-nāyikām" in the opening mangalācarana 
stanza, whence we have translated dpaḥ-mo as yogini.
23. Bde mchog dkar po (115b6): Sita Samvara = R 22 b.
24. Bde mchog dkar po tshe sgrub (120b 1):

CORDIER 2.269).
32. Rdo rje phag mo zhal gñis ma dpyal lugs (162 a 3): Dpyal-lugs. Vajra- 
värähi. In R25 a this deity is Dpyal-lugs Rdo-rje-phag-mo. The epithet 
zhal-gñis-ma is not found with any deity in Two Lamaistic Pantheons 
(index). It may be an abbreviation of zhal-gcig phyag gñis-ma "with

sita Vārāhi yig rñin lugs =R 32 c (lacks yig rñin lugs, which is neces- 
sary to differentiate it from 32b).

pana (37 a-c). The anucaras, Sudhana, Tārā, Bhṛkuți and Hayagrīva 
(in 37 a, c) are reckoned in the five. By oversight 38a repeats 38 c 
Spyan-ras-gzigs Sems-ñid-nal-gso and says that it is redundant (ḥdi 
lhags).
51. Spyan ras gzigs yid bzhin nor bu lha lna(267 b 1): Five Divinities
beginning with Cintamani Avalokitesvara R 38 b (all the five are

Vol. II, B 83, and Sikṣāsamuccaya p. 169 (Vajrapramardin).
= Simhanāda Āryā-58. Hphags pa spyan ras gzigs senge sgra (280 a 2)

59. Spyan ras gzigs rgyal ba rgya mtsho (284 b 2): Jinasagara Avalokite- 
śvara = R 43 c.
6. Drug pa: hphags ma sgrol mahi sgrub thabs (Tārā).
60. Bkaḥ gdams lha bzhihi nan gi sgrol ma (285 b 3): Tārā from among 
the Four Bkaḥ-gdams Divinities = R 44 a.

krama sita Tārā = R 44 c.

65. Sgrol ma yid bzhin nor bu (298 a 4): Cintamani-Tārā = R 45c (cf. 
CORDIER 2.73).

47/48 a.
67. Sgrol ma nor sbyin ma (303 a 1): Dhanada Tārā = R 46/47/48 b. 
68. Sgrol ser gtso ḥkhor gsum (306 a 1): the triad of Pīta Tārā =R 46/47/ 
48 c. The other two are Pita Jambhala (R 49/50 a and Vaiśravana 
R 49/50 b). In the Leningrad copy folio 46 bears the three numbers 46, 
47, and 48, and folio 49 has 49 and 50. These are the original folio 
numbers. Later on four new folios have been added to f. 46-48 and 
49-50 bearing the new numbers 47, 48, 49, and 50. If we omit the 
new nos. 47, 48, 49, 50 then the Rin-ḥbyun conforms to the sequence 
of the Rin-lhan.
69. Rmi lam ston paḥi sgrol ma (307 a 1): Svapnadeśaka Tārā = R 49/50 c.

74. Dpal phyag na rdo rje u tsa rya (315b1): Śrī Ucārya Vajrapāņi =
R 54 C. CLARK has Phyag rdor utsarya in Tibetan, and Hsien hsing shou
193

chih chin kang [2] in Chinese. The character hsien occurs in B 118 Hsien
sheng wang fo [3] where it corresponds to Tib. Sans-rgyas Mnon- 
hphyags-rgyal-po 'Abhyudgatarāja Buddha'. In A, 1 B 56 (ibid. p. 38) 
we have shen ting [4] hsien sheng wang fo in Dhyanābhyudgatarāja 
Buddha. Cf. GRÜNWEDEL, Mythologie des Buddhismus in Tibet und der 
Mongolei, Leipzig 1900, p. 160. It seems that ucarya is derived from 
ut-car.
75. Phyag rdor gos snon can gzuns las byun ba (316 a 6): Dharaṇī-uddhṛta 
nilambaradhara Vajrapāņi = R 55 a (it does not have D°). Cf. CORDIER

76. Phyag rdor sa lugs (317b4): Sa-[skya]-lugs Vajrapāņi= R 55 b. 
77. Phyag rdor gtum chen bsrun baḥi mkhar ras chun lugs (319b3): Ras-

= R 56 a.
79. Phyag rdor gtum chun dmar po (337 a 4): Rakta alpacaṇḍa Vajrapāņi=
R 56 b. CLARK just gives chun without its Sanskrit equivalent. It is clear 
that it forms part of the gradation: mahācanda, canda and alpacanda. 
80. Phyag rdor gos sǹon can ḥgro bzań lugs (338 b 1): Hgro bzań lugs nīlām- 
baradhara Vajrapāņi = R 56 c.
81. Phyag rdor khan brtsegs ma (342 a 6): Kūṭāgāra Vajrapāņi = R57 a 
(without 'ma).

R 57 b.
83. Phyag rdor ḥbyun ḥdul gsar ma (347 b 2): Nava bhūtaḍāmara Vajra- 
pāņi = R 57 c.
8. Brgyad pa: dpal rta mgrin gyi sgrub thabs (Hayagriva).
84. Rta mgrin dpaḥ gcig lhan skyes jo boḥi lugs (351 a 4): Arya-[Atiśa] - 
krama sahaja ekavira Hayagriva = R58 a.
85. Rta mgrin khyun gśog can jo boḥi lugs (355 b 4): Arya-[Atiśa]-krama 
Garuḍapakṣavat Hayagriva = R 58 b.
86. Rta mgrin sva na bzhi skor jo boḥi lugs (360b5): Arya-[Atiśa] 
krama Caturḍākinīparivāra Hayagriva =R 58 c. The four attendant

From the above the exact concord between the Rin-lhan and the Rin- 
ḥbyun is clear beyond doubt; the sadhanas given in the Rin-lhan are 
illustrated in the Rin-ḥbyun. It is only in five cases (R 27 a, b, 68 c, 84 a, b) 
that the divinities illustrated in the Rin-hbyuń are not found in the dkar- 
chag; however, the possibility of their being traced in the Rin-lhan cannot 
be ruled out. In this context we may note that minor divinities are assumed 
to have been included in the divinity to whose parivāra they belong, e. g. 
in R 16 the four anucaras of Nageśvararāja (R 16b) are not separately 
listed in the dkar-chag, though they are illustrated individually in R 16 a 
with the prefixed ḥkhor 'anucara'. We find the same situation in R 35, 
104, 118. In all these cases the main deity occupies the centre of the 
folio 11. In some instances the flanking divinities are not specified as 
anucaras (ḥkhor), e. g. R 13, 33, 105, 116. The anucara divinities contribute 
to the recurrence of the same name more than once, with variations in 
varying contexts.
Besides classifying the bewildering variety of the divinities of the Rin- 
ḥbyun, the Rin-lhan also helps us to clear its textual position. In the Rin- 
hbyun,folios 46-52 have been condensed to three folios, every one of 
them with multiple numbers: 46/47/48, 49/50, and 51/52. CLARK has regular- 
ised the foliation as follows:
Clark Xylograph
4646/47/48
4747
4848
4949
5050
5149/50
5251/52
11 Cf. S. F. GRÜNWEDEL, Sbornik Izobrazhenii 300 Burkhanov, introd. p. ii.
205

Folios 47, 48, 49 and 50 of CLARK are later additions, as is clear from the
Rin-lhan (see above serial no. 68) 12. The reason for adding the new folios 
may have been to complete the number of xylographic plates. R O 70 is 
original (see serial No. 117). The reverse sequence of the Rin-ḥbyun in 
R 67 c ( Rin-lhan 107), 67 b (= 108), 67 a (= 109), R 73c (= 123), 73b 
(= 124), and 73a (= 125) baffles a solution.
The interdependence of the Rin-lhan 13 and the Rin-ḥbyun becomes a 
certainty by their identical inspiration, namely Panchen Lama Bstan-paḥi- 
ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal. The Rin-lhan forms two volumes GA and NA 
of the collected works 14 (gsun-ḥbum) of Rje-btsun blo-bzań-dpal-ldan Bstan- 
paḥi-ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal dpal-bzan-po. Volume GA is the first 
glegs-bam and NA the second. In the colophon contained in the second 
volume it is clearly stated that at the request of the learned dkaḥ-chen's Ye- 
śes-bsam-gtan, Blo-bzan-skal-bzań, Blo-bzan-don-grub, Blo-bzan-yon-tan, Sku- 
skye-dge-hdun-grags-pa, Chos-mdzad-ye-śes bstan-ḥdzin, and others the 
Panchen Lama composed the Rin-lhan as a practical manual giving the rjes- 
gnan and other necessary ritual details about divinities mentioned in the 
Sgrub-thabs-rin-ḥbyun 15.
The Rin-ḥbyun, though a work of the Mongols, was also blessed by the 
same Panchen Lama 16: he wrote the final mangalācarana for the 
xylographs (par-byan smon-tshig), which occurs at the end of the Rin-ḥbyun
12 F. A. PETER, ibid., pp. 3-4.
13 Prof. Dr. F.D. Lessing very kindly sent me his files containing the cut-up 
copy of the Rin-hbyuń, in which he has pasted each divinity on a separate sheet 
of paper. These he has arranged in alphabetic sequence, with the varieties coming 
under the main deitye. g. the various forms of Mañjuśrī come together under 
M. Herein Prof. Lessing has referenced a large number of the divinities to a 
Rin-lhan, which is not the same as ours: firstly its order does not coincide with 
the Rin-ḥbyun and secondly, it is in four vols. GA, NA, CA and CHA against 
ours which consists of only two vols. GA and NA. There were more Rin-lhan's, 
e. g. Čin süjügtü nom-un qayan Blo-bzan-nor-bu-ses-rab, a disciple of Jibcundampa I 
(1635-1723 A.D.) wrote a Sgrub-thabs-rin-hbyun-gi-lhan-thabs in four volumes 
(pothis NA, CA CHA and JA of his opera omnia - LOKESH CHANDRA, Eminent 
Tibetan Polymaths of Mongolia, New Delhi 1961, § 5 p. 21 of the text).
14 His opera omnia consist of four volumes in the set preserved at the State 
Library, Ulanbator (Mongolian People's Republic) -LOKESH CHANDRA, "The Authors
of Sumbums", Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. II (1958), p. 124 no. 79.

tshul-gyi lhan-thabs hdi-lta-bu zhig dgos zhes . . . (beginning of the colophon). 
The dkar-chag begins: Sgrub-thabs-rin-hbyun-nas gsuns-paḥi lha-tshogs-rnams-kyi 
sgrub-thabs-kyi rim-pa phyogs-gcig-tu bkod-pa Rin-hbyun don-gsal zhes-bya-bar I. 
Incidentally the Tibetan name of the sign is don-gyi-slad-du mtshan-nas smos-nas 
(Lama Tshultim).
16 Intimate connections subsisted between the Mongols and this Panchen Lama. 
One of his gurus was the great Mongol polymath Dam-tshig-rdo-rje (1781-1855 
A.D. see LOKESH CHANDRA, Eminent Tibetan Polymaths of Mongolia § 10). The 
third incarnation of Mkhan-chen-chos-rgyal and an illustrious scholar, Tshe-dban- 
skyabs-mchog (born 1789) was ordained by him (Eminent Tibetan Polymaths 
§ 14). He was highly esteemed by the Mongols long after: very recently we find 
Blo-bzan-rta-dbyans alias Rtsa-ba-bla-ma (1867-1937 A.D.) the outstanding scholar 
of Urga, writing a commentary on his gsol-hdebs under the title Pan-chen Bstan- 
paḥi-ñi-maḥi mtshan sgra gsol-hdebs-kyi hgrel-pa blo-gros mig hbyed in vol. KA 
of his opera omnia (Eminent Tibetan Polymaths. . . § 16, p. 65 of the text).

and twice at the end of its two appendices 17: the Snar-than-(brgya-rtsa) and
the Rdor-hphren. It may be worthwhile to point out that F.A. PETER has 
misunderstood the name of the Panchen Lama Blo-bzan-dpal-ldan-paḥi 
Bstan-paḥi-ñi-ma-phyogs-las-rnam-rgyal 18 as referring to Tson-kha-pa. 
Noyan sprul-sku Ratnavajra and the Jibcundampa have also been con- 
fused. Tā bla-ma has been translated as Dalai Lama! Such glaring errors 
abound and it would serve no purpose to point out all of them. Suffice it 
to say that the date assigned by him 19 to the Rin-ḥbyun has to be revised. 
Panchen Lama Bstan-paḥi-ñi-maº lived from 1781 to 1852 according to 
G. SCHULEMANN 20, so the work has to be placed sometimes during this 
period 21.
To sum up, the Rin-lhan puts the amorphous mass of the Rin-hbyun 
pantheon into a well-knit structure. It inspires life in the lines of the other. 
Its esoteric milieu aids better comprehension of the formantic aspects of 
Tibeto-Mongol art as represented by the Rin-ḥbyun.
17 The two appendices form an integral part of the Rin-ḥbyun as testified by the 
title and the colophon at the end of the final portion, the Rdor-hphren. They are 
found in all the copies known at Berlin, Ulanbator, Oriental Institute of Leningrad, 
(both the exemplars), Prof. F. D. Lessing, W. E. Clark and Prof. Raghu Vira. 
So we need not surmise two editions the earlier and later as done by 
F.A. PETER, ibid., p. 4 on the basis of his incomplete copy.
The Rin-lhan pertains to the main portion of the '500 Gods of Narthang', the 
Rin-hbyuń proper. The famous rites of the Snar-than-brgya-rtsa and Rdor-hphren,

done. The Snar-than-brgya-rtsa, along with the Zur-dkaḥ-brgya-rtsa and the 
Rin-hbyun-brgya-rtsa, is a very famous centuple initiation. Abhişeka (dban) into 
the Vajräväli-maṇḍala was also an important rite: it occurs in the Blue Annals 
(tr. G. N. ROERICH) several times (pp. 228, 320, 371, 411, 448, 499, 507, 542, 776, 995,

incomplete.

Notes towards a History of Korean Fiction *
By Peter H. Lee
(New York)
Fiction in Chinese
Although the novel in the modern sense began only in the second quarter 
of the seventeenth century in Korea, its ancestors, legends, anecdotal 
narratives and tales, are as old as human history itself. In Korea, however, 
where Chinese literature had a strong hold among the literati and where 
their proper system of writing developed only in the fifteenth century, 
it is not surprising that earlier surviving examples of fiction were strongly 
influenced by Chinese fiction and used the Chinese language as their medium. 
There is a rich collection of folk tales in Korea in the form of Märchen, 
novella, hero tales, sage, pourquoi stories, myths, legends, fables, and 
jests¹. The oldest surviving examples of such folk tales are preserved in 
the Samguk sagi [1] and Samguk yusa [2]. The Samguk yusa2, a collection of 
popular stories and folk tales, records a number of examples, foundation 
myths of Tangun [3] 3, Puyo [414, and of Kara [5] 5, and other unusual

THE RIN-LIIANSADH AN A-MALA
of
Panchen Lama Bstan-pahi-ni-ma-phyogs-las-mam-rgy al
edited by
Prof. Dr. LOKESH CHANDRA

PREFACE
In the accompanying pages we have reproduced a few initial 
folios of the "Yi-lam-rgy a-nt shohi sgrub-thabs rin-chen-hbyun- 
gnas-kyi lhan-thabs rin-hbyuh don gsal". The original xylograph 
runs into two volumes with 519 and 470 folios respectively.It
is of great interest for iconographic studies.
It forms two volumes GA and NA of the collected works 
(gsun-hbum) of the Panchen Lama Bstan-pahi-ni-ma-phyog s-las-m am- 
rgy al. In the colophon of the second volume it is clearly stated 
that at the request of learned scholars and eminent householders,
the Panchen Lama composed this work as a practical manual giving 
the anujña and other necessary details about divinities mentioned 
in the Sgrub-thabs-rin-hbyun.
The margin of the xylograph has the short signature 
Rin-lhan. It distinguishes this work from its complement, the 
"Rin-hbyuh Shar-than brgy a-rtsa Rdor-hphren bc as-nas gsuns-pahi 
bris-sku mthon-ba don-1dan" commonly referred to as the "Tive 
Hundred Gods of Narthang," which according to its marginal 
signature is the Rin-hbyun.
The Rin-lhan is the original sadh an a-collection which is 
illustrated in the in-hbyun. It is the first important instance 
of its kind and a long-awaited opportunity when an ancient pantheon 
can be studied in its original sadhana-setting. Three other 
iconographic manuals are also known: the "Three Hundred Gods" 
of Lc an-sky a Qutuɣtu Lalitavajra, "Chu Fo P'u-sa Sheng Hsi ang 
Tsan" containing 360 divinities again ascribed to Lc ah-sky a 
Qutuɣtu, and the Pao-hsi ang Lou pantheon with 766 preserved

images or inscribed pedestals
but for none of them do we
have the original text. The correlation of iconography and
ritual will lead to a better comprehension of the complex details
of the icons and their meditation al contexts.
The sadhan as in this booklet pertain to the following
deities: Cintamanic akra White Tara, according to the traditions 
of Atisa, Ba-ri, Gñan, and Vanaratna, White Sarasvati,
Sadanga Tara of Gñan, Kurukulla, and Red Kamaraja.

SANSKRIT STUDIES IN CLASSICAL INDONESIA
In March 1972 a Balinese scholar Tjokorda Rai Sudharta came to 
New Delhi to attend the International Sanskrit Conference convened 
by the Government of India. He presented a paper on << Sanskrit in 
Bali », wherein he cited the so-called Sanskrit chrestomathy Svara- 
samhita as an example. This manuscript was copied for the Arts Faculty 
of Udayana University, Denpasar (Bali) in 1885 Saka (1963 A.D.). It 
consists of 98 palm leaves (lontar) written on both sides. Each page 
carries four lines with approximately 32 to 34 Sanskrit words and their 
meanings.
<Kṣatra na san ratu (the king), anvayah na vka-vkanira (his sons), 
pańktiratha na saǹ Dasaratha (king Dasaratha), abhidhānaḥ na yawakani 
naranira (is called his ownself), bhartta na ratunya (his king), bhuvoh 
ǹa Imahnya (his earth), bhanudinah na hyan Aditya (the god Sun), 
prabhavaḥ na viryya (dignity), akhanda na tanpiyak (indivisible), wanoh 
na kahankaranira (his selfishness), manujeśvarāṇām na san ratur (the 
king), manyah na pinujanira (worshipped by him), manojñai na konaǹ- 
unan (happiness), gunajñeḥ na kasaktyan (power), gunajñaḥ na pujaj- 
nanati, cakāra na gave, etc. (na means is') » ¹.
Evidently it is not a << vocabulary >, but a fine specimen of an 
ornate Sanskrit kavya. Reading through the ensuing folios it became 
clear that it is a kavya of Rāma, recalling the mellifluous stanzas of 
the Janakiharana. Eagerly glancing through the Janakiharana, it turned 
out to be the second half of the twelfth stanza and the first half of 
the 13th.

Lokesh Chandra114
To our great joy and amazement here, at last, was the discovery of 
a Sanskrit kavya on Indonesian soil, whose faded memories lingered 
on in fragments in the Svarasamhita, an eclectic collection of stray bits 
of grammar, kavya, bija-mantras, synonyms and the like. The first 
eleven and a half stanzas were missing in the Balinese lontar. We 
started a search for these lost stanzas in the Kṛtabhāṣā lontars kept 
at the Leiden University. Cod. Or. 5089 began: avighnam astu // 0 // 
asitya dadi / davanyam Imah / mati atiśaya / etc. So here we were in 
the beginning of the Janakiharana. Cod. Or. 5089 is a cakěpan, 45 cm. 
in length, 11 folia, written in two lines, with interlinear translation 2. 
It stems from the Lombok collection, which is distinguished by the 
degree of accuracy of its lontars as well as their unique contents. The 
Lombok codex unfortunately ends abruptly in the middle of the 28th 
stanza of the first canto. The text of the Janakiharana from the Lombok 
codex is reproduced as an appendix to this article.
Interlinear Sanskrit and Kawi texts were used by aspirants for 
proficiency in Sanskrit to improve their Kawi diction. This has been 
the tradition in Indonesia down to our times when men of culture 
studied Daśanama and allied lexica on synonymy to better their know- 
ledge of Kawi. When Rabindranath Tagore visited Indonesia, his host 
the Sultan astonished the poet by reciting several synonyms for a river, 
while they were driving past a river: two hearts reincarnating a common 
cultural milieu. In the study of modern Indian languages as well, the 
learning of Sanskrit is a must for elegance of style and for the creation 
of words for new ideas. It was an established practise not so long ago 
that << the Janakiharana was one of the texts studied by those in Ceylon 
who desired to obtain a proficiency in the Sanskrit language. This is 
indicated by the fact that a word for word paraphrase (sanne) in 
Sinhalese, was produced about the twelfth century, by an unknown 
scholar, for the whole poem. Manuscripts of this Sinhalese sanne of 
the Janakiharana, though incomplete, are still extant »³. We may 
conclude that in Indonesia of the Classical period the Janakiharana 
served a similar function of enriching the Kawi poet's repertoire of 
literary refinement.
The Classical curriculum of a poet's training comprised grammar, 
metrics, dramaturgy, lexicography, and poetics. This tradition of five 
subjects has been preserved in Tibet and they are known as the « Five 
Minor Sciences »: Tib: sgra-rig-pa (vyakarana, grammar), sdeb-sbyor 
(chandas, metrics), zlos-gar (nāṭaka, dramaturgy), mnon-brjod (abhi- 
dhāna, lexicography i.e. for synonyms), sñan-nag (kavya, poetics for

alankara). The training of Kālidāsa comprised proficiency in grammar, 
nighantu (lexicography), prose-writing (padya-racana) which corresponds 
to dramaturgy in the foregoing enumeration, and poetics (kāvya-śāstra) 
which is metrics and alankara in the previous list. The life of Kālidāsa 
is inscribed on the slab Ep. Zey. 1:20, Elleväva Pillar Inscription of 
Dappula (Ep. Zey. 5:35), Slab no. Mll in the Anuradhapura Museum, 
Bō Maluva Pillar, and Rock Inscription at Rajagala. It reads: Kālidāso 
'cirenaiva samskṛta-bhāṣāṁ ca samskṛta-vyakarana-śāstrañ ca nighan- 
tūms ca... padya-racanã-śāstrañ ca kavya-śāstrañ ca adhitya maha- 
panaito bhutvā sthitaḥ5.
Does Indonesia still preserve texts pertaining to these Literary Arts? 
Yes, it does. The Chinese pilgrim-scholar I-tsing attests the study of 
Sanskrit grammar in Indonesia: « Before sailing twenty days the ship 
reached Srivijaya, where I landed and stayed six months, gradually 
learning the sabdavidya (Sanskrit grammar) »". Miss Shashibala of the 
International Academy of Indian Culture, who is working on Sanskrit 
grammatical texts from Indonesia, has discovered to the great surprise 
of the scholarly world, that major systems of Sanskrit grammar like 
Panini, Sarasvata, Vararuci, Kāśakṛtsna and Katantra are represented in 
Indonesia, mostly their sections on sandhi, nominal compounds (samāsa) 
and some declensions and conjugations. The kärikäs of Katantra on the 
cases are known under the title of Karaka-sangraha". Its purpose is 
stated at the end to be the authoritative interpretation and appropriate 
comprehension of the metaphysical or spiritual precepts of the guru: 
Paratma-tattvam samyujya yuktitaś cintyam ātmasāt / 
pramani-krtya vākyāni gurūktāni manīṣinā //
Bali has preserved to this day two different commentaries on the Karaka- 
sangraha, one from the grammatical and the other from the philoso- 
phical view-point.
Sanskrit lexicography is richly represented by the Amaramālā, Daśa- 
nāma, Adiśvara, Ekalavya, Samuha-vacana, lists of mono-syllabic words, 
and several other texts without titles. The main purpose was to extend 
the dimensions of vocabulary by providing large number of synonyms.
Alankara or literary embellishment is known from a solitary (so 
far!) text which commences with the words: saḥ vrkṣaḥ ikan kayu. 
sah vrkṣaḥ tisṭhati lagiya di. tat kananam ikan alas. kusumitam makam- 
baniya. tasmin känane kusumite nankana lagi ya. sa latā ikan udvad.

How do we know that it is a text pertaining to alankara-sastra? During 
a visit to Indonesia in 1976, I had the pleasure of consulting its lontar 
whose cover palmleaf had the word Lěnkṛta, inscribed insignificantly 
in a corner which could easily escape notice. It is significant that such 
a title does not appear in any of the catalogues of the collections at 
Leiden and Singaraja (Bali). This text represents a faithful record 
of the oral teaching on ars poetica, with the constant repetition of the 
phrases, as if it were a live tape recording of a class-room lesson. It is 
an interesting document of ancient pedagogics. In India too a teacher 
sitting under a tree would commence his lessons in alankara-sastra with 
the << tree >> itself, for it was the immediate environment of the taught. 
There is a traditional anecdote about the Sanskrit writer Bāṇa, who 
is renowned for his classic prose-kavya entitled Kadambarī. He had 
hardly reached halfway in this work, when he felt that his days were 
at end. He summoned both sons to his bedside to find out the one who 
could complete it in all brilliance of descriptions, vivid similes, and 
resplendent phraseology. He asked his learned grammarian son to put 
in words: << here is the tree ». He put it in terse and grammaticised 
exactitude: vrkṣas tisthaty agre« the tree stands in front >>; hard and 
stiff with every word in the brace of sandhi. The second son trained in 
flowing and rhythmical prose expressed it as: tarur iha vilasati purataḥ 
abjuring harsh sandhis and syllables, each word gracefully flowing into 
the next. Bāṇa decided that his second son Bhuṣaṇa-bhatta should com- 
plete the remainder of Kadambari. Such is the legend from the vast 
traditions of India's literary heritage, still recounted by a teacher to 
his disciples. One fact stands out that the motif of the << tree » was a 
starting-point and index-mark in alankara studies and Indonesia por- 
trays in her lontars a fragment of this vanished oral tradition in 
vivid detail.
In the domain of metrics, we have the Chandah-kirana (or Canda- 
kirana) 10 which is the earliest known chrestomathy giving metres, 
synonyms of the Amara-mālā and homonyms. It belongs to the genre 
of literary textbooks or reference-works which were studied by aspiring 
writers as well as consulted by accomplished authors. Another text is 
11
the Vṛtta-sañcaya " by Mpu Tanakung. These works were not merely 
theoretical expositions but they provided standards for metres exten- 
sively employed in kakawins. The exemplification of these metres could

be seen in Sanskrit kävyas like the Janaki-harana and Ravana-vadha 
alias Bhaṭṭikavya which were prevalent in Indonesia.
The Rāmāyana Kakawin and its relationship with the Bhaṭṭi-kavya 
deserves a detailed analysis. The opening verse of the Rāmāyaṇa Kaka- 
win can be compared to the Bhaṭṭi-kavya thus:
hana sira ratu dibya rěnön,
abhut nṛpaḥ vibudha sakhaḥ
praśāsta rin rat, musuhnira pranata,
tapahparan- 
jaya, pandita rin aji kabeh
śrutānvitaḥ
san Dasaratha nama tā moli //
Dasaratha ity udahṛtaḥ
We can see that the Sanskrit text has been reproduced in Kawi, word 
by word:
abhun nṛpo vibudha-sakhaḥ paran-tapah
śrutanvito Dasaratha ity udahṛtaḥ /
The Kawi author was a genius who could transcreate cach and every 
word with a minimum of addition and subtraction, in amazing simpli- 
city of structure and limpid flow of words in Kawi, as compared to the 
elaborate recondite style of Bhatti. The Rāmāyaṇa Kakawin has the 
refinement of austerity of words, like a Zen painting where the empty 
white spaces are beauty (śunvatā rūpam), in contradistinction to Bhatti's 
academic exultation in grammar and figures of speech providing joy of 
crudition to his commentators. In the Kawi stanza, there are two clauses. 
which are not found in the Bhatti-kavya: prasasta rin rat « renowned 
throughout the world », jaya « victorious ». Java can be a clarification 
of the preceding musuhnira pranata « his enemies were subdued ». The 
two additions can also be an echo in the poet's mind of Janakiharana 
1.12-25 which is prolix in its eulogy of the virtues and glory of king 
Dasaratha, specifically 1.14 cd jigiṣur abhyasta-samasta-sastra-jñān-opa- 
ruddhendriya-vegaḥ. Here it may be recalled that several Rāmāyaṇa texts 
were prevalent in Indonesia and even the Sanskrit alphabet was taught 
through this epic. The Janakīkāvya 12 in 51 stanzas was meant for this 
purpose and each stanza containing one letter of the alphabet must have
12. Edited in SYLVAIN LEVI, Sanskrit Texts from Bali, Baroda, 1933, pp. 89-93 as 
Kavi-Janaki. Sylvain Lévi omitted all Kawi prefixes and suffixes, and in this process 
ka-an of ka-kavin was eliminated, and a ghost-word kavi was created. Kakavin 
would be Janaki-kavya in Sanskrit syntactic order. Prof. Lévi also failed to discern 
that every stanza contained a letter of the alphabet: this could have avoided wrong 
allocation of lines and it could also lead to a better text. The whole text is being 
re-edited by the author. The last stanza should commence with the last letter of the 
alphabet, namely, ha. In Lévi it begins atta-satru-mahendräni. It has to be emended 
to hata-satrur mahendra-bhih « he had vanquished his enemies and was a terror 
even to Mahendra ».

been accompanied by illustrations in ancient times to allure the young 
students, as the Ramayana comics in Bahasa Indonesia published by the 
Tan Kun Sri Bookshop at Kediri are a delight for the Indonesian 
children today. The Caritra Rāmāyana 13 is another example of a Rā- 
māyaṇa text used to teach nominal compounds. In India too, creative 
writing was taught in an integral manner combining grammatical rules, 
figures of speech, metres, vocabulary, and cultural imagery of Classical 
myths and legends. This integrative approach can be discovered in the 
Bhaṭṭikavya where all these elements are abundantly illustrated in a 
refined and elaborate art. For example the Bhaṭṭi-kävya has been ex- 
plained from the standpoint of different systems of Sanskrit grammar, 
namely, those of Kalapa, Mugdhabodha and Panini in Gurunatha Vidya- 
nidhi Bhattacharya's edition published from Calcutta in 1893. While a 
kāvya was aesthetic joy in its lucid charm, it was a holistic system 
of education embracing at once the five basic disciplines mentioned 
earlier in this paper.
The kingdom of Śrīvijaya was an international centre of Sanskrit 
studies and the efforts of the kings of Śrīvijaya for the conservation 
of Sanskrit literature are attested by the Simhalese chronicle Suvar- 
napura-vamsa said to have been written in the eleventh century. S. Para- 
navitana 14 has summed up the situation so clearly that it bears citation: 
<< The ancient Suvarnṇapura, better known as Śrīvijaya (the modern 
Palembang), was a great centre of Sanskrit studies. The library of the 
Maharaja of Śrīvijaya is said to have contained, in the fifteenth century, 
many famous Sanskrit books that were not available at that time in 
India itself. Among the pandits of Suvarnṇapura, there were prevalent 
many traditions about the history and literature of India, either pre- 
served orally or in writing on palm-leaves ».
« The ancient kingdom of Suvarnṇapura was on the decline in the 
fifteenth century, and was maintaining itself with great difficulty against 
the threat of Muslim Sultanates that had arisen all around it. Parakra- 
mabahu VI of Kōṭṭe, who was a scion of the Kalinga, i.e. Śrīvijaya, 
branch of the Sinhalese royal family, was able to read the portents of 
the times, and was anxious to preserve for posterity, something of the 
rich historical traditions that the land of his birth was heir to. He had 
copies of many of the rare books brought to Jayavardhanapura (Kōṭṭe), 
and preserved them in his own library ». The Indonesian scholars of 
Suvarnṇapura had preserved on palmleaves an account of the life of 
Kalidasa which has been found engraved on stone-inscriptions in Srilanka 
(Ceylon) 14. An ancient precursor of modern << oral history projects »!
Even the Janakiharana was brought to Srilanka (Ceylon) from Indo- 
nesia. S. Paranavitana 15 says: « Parakramabahu VI of Kōṭṭe (1410-1465)

Sanskrit Studies in Classical Indonesia119
having learned that the original Sanskrit text of the Janakiharana was 
nowhere procurable in Ceylon, inquired from the members of his aca- 
demy whether it was possible for any one of them to recompose the 
stanzas of the poem with the words given in the Sinhalese Sanne (word- 
for-word paraphrase). Rājasundara-pandita, a learned Brahmin, told the 
king that he could do so, and Parakramabahu made the provision neces- 
sary for him to undertake and carry out this task. When Rājasundara- 
pandita had completed the re-composing of the stanzas up to the end 
of Canto X, information reached Parakramabahu that a copy of the full 
original poem was available in the Pundra country (Malabar). A copy 
of this manuscript was obtained for the king's library. In the mean- 
time. the original poem had also been found in the possession of a 
pandit at a village close to Suvarnṇapura (Palembang). A copy of this 
was also obtained for the library of Parakramabahu VI.
«The two manuscripts were also found to be at variance with 
regard to certain verses. The manuscript from Suvarnṇapura also con- 
tained a large number of verses which were not found in the Sinhalese 
Sanne, nor in the manuscript from the Pundra country. It was con- 
tended by Ananda-sthavira, a learned monk from Suvarnṇapura, that 
the variant readings in the manuscript from that country were emen- 
dations made by Kumāradāsa himself, who is said to have sojourned 
for a prolonged period there, after the completion of the poem in 
Ceylon. The additional verses were also taken by Ananda-sthavira to be 
compositions of Kumāradāsa himself. Buddharakṣita sthavira, on the 
other hand, was of opinion that the variant readings in the Suvarnṇa- 
pura manuscript had been deliberately introduced by some one in Su- 
varṇnapura, and, that the additional verses found therein were the 
laboured composition of a poetaster, who lived long after Kumāradāsa ».
Indonesian lontars have conserved some early versions of Sanskrit 
texts, for instance, Cod. Or. 5110 16 in the Leiden University Library 
has the earliest known version of Bhartṛhari's work, with the captions 
lokayātrā, samsara-nindā, viṣaya-heyata. It is a cakěpan in 20 folios 
which are 46 cm long. It is from the Lombok collection which continued 
traditions of the libraries of the Śrīvijaya kingdom.
In conclusion, we can say that the Indonesian literati had access 
to all branches of Sanskrit learning and they put these disciplines to 
the best of use in the emergence of their own creative literature, as it 
happened in later centuries in India when Sanskrit provided models 
for modern Indian languages both of the north and south. The adven- 
ture of new discoveries of the Classical world and Sanskrit texts in 
Indonesia awaits fresh and keen minds.

IN SEARCH OF BUDDHI ST MANUSCRIPTS IN EASTERN SI BERI A

Director
International Academy of Indian Culture,
New Delhi-16 (India)
(This a short preliminary report of the 
first Indian Cultural Delegation to the 
Bury at ASSR. A detailed scientific report 
will come out in 4 volumes)
Presented on the occasion of the
XXVII International Congress of Orientalists
held at Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. A.
August 1967

Beyond the placid and shimmering blue waters of Lake Baikal in
the heart of Eastern Siberia lie the fabled lands of the Buryats, 
known as the Bury at ASSR and the Chita Autonomous Region. They are 
the dreamland of a Buddhologist with their richly endowed monasteries, 
studded with icons of rare charm, resplendent with silken scrolls of 
thankas and stacked with xylographs and manuscripts of historic value- 
preserved with loving care by the savant lamas under the guidance of 
the ecclesiastical department of the Government of the USSR. For years
on end, we had dreamt of seeing these historic treasures. Long last, 
in February 1967, Bandida =(Sanskrit Pandita) Hambo Lama, J. D. Gomboev, 
Chairman of the Central Religious Board of the Buddhists of the USSR, 
sent an invitation which read:
"The Central Religious Board of the Buddhists of the USSR is 
happy to invite you to visit our Bury at Republic and be a guest of the 
Buddhists of the Soviet Union. You may visit us at any time convenient 
for you.
"We shall be also very glad to receive together with you two of 
your colleagues in science and Buddhism.
"Your visit to our country will make great contribution into the 
cause of consolidating peace and friendship between our countries." 
Meandering through different post offices, the invitation 
reached me on the 10th of April, 1967. I acknowledged receipt of the 
gracious invitation of the Bandida Hambo Lama and the three-man dele- 
gation was composed of Dr. Mrs. Sharada Rani, Mr. Kailash Chandra and 
my self. Various formalities took nearly two months while cables flashed 
back and forth. Ours was the first Indi an Delegation to visit the 
"closed-door republic" of the Bury at ASSR. Finally, on the 7th of June,
1967 we left by the Aeroflot to Moscow, en route to Ulan-ude. Moscow
was exceptionally chilly, but a warm welcome awaited us at the airport

Sog to Purboyev who is specialising in Chinese and English at a Moscow 
Institute. Sog to is the Bury at pronunciation of čogtu. Prof. 
Baldanzhabov hastened to tell us that Sog to is Sanskrit śrī. We found 
in our consequent travels that a Bury at takes delight in being able to

of Bury at life and the strides it has taken after the Revolution. We
were told of a rare manuscript of about a 1000 folios compiled by a 
Bury at scholar. It gires corrections in seven editions of the Kanjur, 
namely, Narthang, Derge, Peking, Chone, Lithang, Urga and Lhasa.
Late in the night at 22.30 we left Moscow for Ulan-ude, a city 
which was founded in 1666 by Russians. It celebrated its 300th anni- 
versary last year, and a special volume was published to commemorate 
the occasion: Ulan-ude 300 Lyet (180 pp.by V.V. Inki zhinov and others 
(Ulan-ude 1965). Next year in 1966 a short historic sketc. by N.V. Kim 
appeared: Očerki Istorii Ulan-ude. After a short stay at Irkutsk, we 
reached Ulan-ude in the afternoon of 10 th June. We were received by 
the Buddhist Patriarch Bandida Hambo Lama, Mr. Ochirzhabov Damdin the 
Chairman of the Religions Department in the Ministry of Culture of the 
Bury at ASSR, Mr. Badma Tserin, Deputy Director of the Ivolginsky Datsan, 
interpretor Mrs. Vera Andrey eva and others. On the way, Mrs. Vera told 
us that she was a Bury at from the Irkutsk region, and hence her Russian

have two names. For instance, the name of the father of Mrs. Vera was 
Qanqal in Bury at and Nikolai in Russian. We were taken to the only 
hotel at Ulan-ude,, the Odon Zbezda (odon 'star' in Buryat). As we sat
t tea, we were presented with an album of modern Soviet Bury at painters

(Khu do zhniki Bury atii, Leningrad 1960). A few artists paint in the
traditional style: the most outstanding amo ng them is Mrs. Sakharov-
skay a Mrs. Gerasimova is a historian of Buddhist art from the 
atheistic point of view. Her research work will appear in the coming 
years. We were told that there are direct descendants of Russians of 
the 17th century who came to lay the foundations of Ulan-ude. They are 
known as sime skiya or staroabratsi among the Bury ats. The whole of 
Bury atia as well as the Mongolian People's Republic get their electri- 
city from the gigantic electric station at Irkutsk. In the last fifteen 
years three more hy droelectric stations have been erected at Bratsk, 
Angarsk and Irkutsk. The Bandida Hambo Lama welcomed us with the words: 
"We love a respect your culture". He told us that mineral water is 
aršan in Bury at, which is a Sanskrit word. We were welcomed with 
"white food" as is the national custom. Milk products are offered when 
an honored guest arrives. Asked about the milk yield, we were told 
that a cow gives 5-20 litres of milk per day, depending upon the season. 
The conversation drifted on to the etymology of the Transbaikali an 
toponyms, most of which have har ly been explained. Prof. Baldanzhabov 
told us that an old tribe lived on the shores of Baikal which spoke a 
Turkic language. As the folk etymology oes Baikal is split up as bai 
'existing, being, having' + kal 'fire'. He was unable to correlate 
the connection of 'fire' with a water expanse and he proposed that in 
Turkic it should mean 'standing water'. In this context we may recall 
the Sanskrit concept of Vadavanala, the submarine fire or the fire of 
the lower regions, fabled to emerge from a cavity called the 'mare's 
mouth' under the sea at the South pole. Mahabharata 1.6802 relates the 
whole legend in details.It wld be interesting to compare it with the
Bury at legends collected by Dr. Ily asov in his article "About Toponymic

- 5 -
Legends". The River Anggara is said to be the daughter of Lake Baikal 
whence she flows.Anggara is again a Turkic word meaning 1a hole
through rock walls'.Recently, Birtag ay ev has written on the classifi- 
cation of the ten Bury at dialects.Asked if the Classical Bury at
script is still taught in the schools, we were told only the Teachers 
Training Institute at Ulan-ude and the Universities of Irkutsk and 
Leningrad teach the Classical Script. We were further informed of the 
great strides in modern Bury at literature in the post-Revolutionary 
period. A short history has been compiled by a committee consisting 
of L.E. Iliasov, V. A. Abramov, A. A. Belousov, Ts.-A. Dug ar-Nimaev, G.0. 
Tudenov and published from Ulan-ude in 1959 by the Bury at skoe Kni zhnoe 
Izdatel' stvo under the title of Očer Istorii Buryatskoi Sovietskoi 
Literatur. In the evening we went for a stroll in the campus of the 
vast gricultural Institute which faces the Hotel 'Odon'. There we met 
the daughter of Prof. Baldanzhabov Mrs. Svetl na Sirgye and her husband 
Mr. Sirgye. Mrs. Svetlana spoke fluent English. She teaches English
at a Russian school. In the Bury at ASSR there are two types of schools: 
Bury at schools and Russian schools. In the Bury at schools the Bury at
language is the medium of instruction with Russian as a compulsory
language. These are found mostly in the country-side.In the towns
and cities Russian schools are prevalent. Russian is their medium, with 
Bury at as a compulsory language. The Bury ats are proud of their langu- 
age and literature. They point out that they have preserved the classi 
cal structure of words better than Khalkha, eg. narhan for Classical 
nafasun, whereas Khalkha has nars. The Soviet policy of promoting their 
culture helps them to preserve their linguistic and literary heritage.
Early in the morning of 10th June we left for Ivolginsky Datsan, 
the headquarters of the Central Religious Board of the Buddhists of the

- 6 -
USSR and the seat of Bandida Hambo Lama, its President. The town of
Ivolginsk is about 40 kilometres from Ulan-ude.It derives its name
from the Russian iva 'willow'. In former times when it was founded
by the Russians willows grew here aplenty. The Monastery was cons-
truc ed here in 1948. At the Monastery we were received by the 
Bandida Hambo Lama, the Deputy IIambo Sibirnov Tsiden, Lama Badmay ev 
Yishidorje, Lama himba-jamso (Representative of the Aginsky Monastery), 
several other lamas and a large crowd of devotees. We were welcomed 
with yoghurt mixed with honey and other ingredients 8corresponding to
Sanskrit madhu parka. A feast of 'white dishes' of milk awaited us- 
dried cream of milk called urm, a national dish of cherries and butter 
which has medicinal properties of prolonging life, milk-rice pudding 
(Sanskrit pay asa) and others. 
As we sat in the guest room, the 
Bandida Hambo Lama told us that the Central Relig s of the 
Buddhists of the USSR was headed by him and there were two Deputy 
Chairman from the Ivolginsky and Aginsky monasteries. The Ivolginsky 
was represented by the Deputy Hambo Lama and the Aginsky by its Hambo 
Lama. In the Board there are other learned lamas, layman, scholars 
and government representatives. After the formal reception we were
taken to the main hall of the Ivolginsky which has the Tibetan name 
Hi bo dge rgy as bkra is chos ḥkhor glin. This name is inscribed on 
top of the entrance in Tibetan letters. 
Worship is held in this temple. 
A special service was conducted in our honour for one hour in full aira 
of the sonorous instruments. Fifteen lamas took part in the recitation 
of the Stotra to Sixteen Arhats and other holy texts in Tibetan. An
innovation is the introduction of the recitation of the Pali Mangala 
sutta because of the several Ceylonese, Nepalese and Cambodian 
Buddhist leaders and delegations that have visited 1 continue to

7.
visit the USSR. Since the tenure of office by Prof. Malalasekera as 
the Ambassador of Ceylon to Moscow, the Bury at Buddhists have had 
intimate relations with Ceylonese Buddhists. Modern Ceylonese and 
Nepalese prints of dagobas, scenes from the life of Lord Buddha and 
other Buddhist representations hang at both the monasteries of Ivol- 
ginsky and Aginsky. The interior is gorgeously decorated in tradi- 
tional style. I would like to refer the readers to the photographs at 
the end of this paper. Out in the precincts are two stupas constructed 
recently. There is a commemorative stupa to the f er Bandida Hambo 
Lama, Venerable Sharapov Yeshedorje. Sharapov is the russified form 
of s-rab 'prajña'. His Sanskrit nae was Prajña-jñāna-vajra 
(प्रज्ञाज्ञानवज्र ). The stupa was completed in 1963 and consecrated as 
the Dge hdun mchod rten (the spelling is not certain). The second
stūpa is the Dpal ldan hbras spun mchod_rten (श्रीधान्यकटक- स्तूप ) or 
the Drepung stūpa. The Bury ats belong to the Gomang yig-cha of the 
Drepung Monastery at Lhasa. It is a charming edifice, founded in 1958. 
We again went to the central temple on top of which is the blos 
bslan gi khan pa or the Mandala Hall. It has the architectonic mandala 
of Samvara (3de mchog gi blos bslan) depicted as an architectural 
edifice. There were a number of scrolls painted with mandalas, the 
most exquisite among them was the mandala of Sarv avid (Kun rig gi ras 
bris dkyil hkhor). Around the blos bslan is the library of the Ivol- 
ginsky Datsan. It is the proud owner of a rare Yisün erdeni-yin 
Ganjur or nava-ratna Kanjur, written in nine inks prepared from silver, 
mumin, coral, turquoise, gold, copper, pearls, iron and conch. It was 
scribed about 80 years ago from the Narthang tion. The monastery 
has the complete set in 101 volumes. The initial folios are minia-
tured in color with the images of deities.There are several thousand

• 8 -
manuscripts and xylographs in Tibetan and Mongolian. They are arranged 
and kept subject-wise with their short titles written on kha yig cloth 
sticking out. Most of the sumbum (opera omnia) are available in stray 
volumes. The librarian is a venerable old lama of 80 years, Prof. 
Balchinov Lobsang-yeshe who is endowed with encyclopaedic knowledge in 
all branches of Buddhist learning.
In 1956 when the Bandida Hanbo Lana attended the Budda Jayanti 
in India he brought seeds of the Holy Tree from Bodhgaya. Ile planted 
it in a special wooden temple in 1957. It is a glasshouse with heating 
arrangements. Fertilisers have been used liberally. The Bandida Hambo 
Lana told us with filial affection how he had cared for the Holy Tree 
which is eleven years old now. Ile could hardly restrain his overflowing 
emotions as he talked of the loving care which he had bestowed to 
nourish the Tree. It was going to outgrow the temple ceiling. To 
survive the extreme cold of Bury atia it had to be in the warmth of an 
interior. What c A he do for it. 
A Burmese delegation had visited 
the temple and they had suggested that the Japanese tec ique of mini a- 
turisation be applied. The Bandida Hambo Lana desperately wanted me to 
send a book on this t chnique. He was also keen to have the seeds or 
saplings of the sandalwood tree 47Candan is an auspicious tree of
Bury at tales and legends.
Like the yurts of old, there were a number of separate house- 
units for v rious purposes, eg. a storehouse for old images, a hall 
for preparing baling ( ), summer house of the Bandida Hambo Lama,
a room for heating the central temple through pipes, etc. A new guest- 
house was under construction. Most of them are simple wooden structures,
in vivid contrast to the central temple whose picturesque architecture, 
sweetly tinkling bells, and melody of colour lends an overall charm and

9-
casts an enchanting spell over the entire monastic complex.
At noon, we were given special Bury at dishes of raisins and
the plant saranta which has a curious taste as if the Indian khir and 
mohanbhog had been blended into 
a single flavor. The milk dishes were 
served in wooden utensils, and the spoons too were wooden. The milk 
dishes pertain to the holy and honored. In Indian homa also, the 
utensils and spoons are preferably wooden. The juice of oblipekha 
was served. It is an indigenous Bury at drink from Ayurvedic medicine, 
a tonic for the lungs. The Bandida Hambo Lama opined that modern 
medicine should research its properties for heart diseases.Outside,
the sky was overcast and a light drizzle lent chill to the breeze. 
When rain accompanies a guest, it is auspicious, so goes the Bury at 
saying. The lamas, scientists, officials and interpretors who accom- 
panied us were happy that our visit to the monastery was b? ssed by rain. 
The meadows were enlivened by tiny yellow flowers of nezabutka or 
forget-me-nots.These innocent 
flowerlings reminded us not to forget 
the inspiring hours spent at the Monastery. The Monastery ever spreads
before our eyes and surges ever anew into the deeps of our soul, as
Bandida Hambo Lama's smiling face and humour breaks us into peels of 
laughter.
Besides the Ivolginsky 
Monastery. there are four other monas- 
teries.Guzino zersky is hallowed as the first monastery of Buryatia. 
It is an architectural 
monument without any xylographs or manuscripts. 
So also the Tsugolsky Monastery. In Kiakhta too, there is a monastery 
which is not functioning now. The Aginsky Monastery is most highly 
venerated as the former seat of Bury at scholarship and learning which 
gave to the world scholars like Zamc arano, Tsybikov and Baradiin.
The 
town of Ivolginsky has a Sovkhoz where tomatoes, cucumber

10
and other vegetables are gown all round the year. Its annual yield
is high33it produces 7000 kilograms of cucumber in every season. 
All the produce is supplied to the State, which distributes it to the 
villages, towns and cities. The glass-houses were unbearably hot 
inside and the soil virtually consisted of a thick layer of fertilizers. 
As the watch reminded us of the vanishing afternoon, we rushed 
back to Ulan-ude, a distance of about 40 kilometres from the Monastery. 
In the evening, we saw the modern Wedding Palace near the Opera Theatre. 
In 1940 Bury at artists went to partake in a festival at Moscow. They 
were highly applauded and it was decided to start a regular theatre 
at Uan-ude. The theatre was opened in 1952. Today, there are 400 
artists and artistes. Two of them, both Bury ats, are the proud reci- 
pients of the award of "Peoples' Artists of the Soviet Union": Mr. 
Linkhavoin, an outstanding singer and Madame Sakhi anova, the perfect 
balleria. Both of them will come to India in September 1967. The 
Theatre is embellished with the national symbol of zargule moitom or 
the Eternal Bind of Hap iness, the Srivatsa of Sanskrit, one of the 
eight auspicious emblems (asta-maicala). The Bury at theatre had gone 
out of town. That evening a guest troupe of the Komsomolska on Amur 
Theatre was presenting a Russian show, directed by Mrs. Ivanova Vasi- 
ly evska Aliftina. The Amur city has been inhabited by the Russians 
since 35 years. Late in the evening we visited the College of Music, 
with the Deputy Minister of Culture. It trains teachers for schools. 
There are 25 children's music schools in the Bury at Repu Lic. The 
College will turn out 36 graduates during the current year. Its 
students took part in competitions in the East Siberian Zonal Festival 
and they (the Bury at group) won the first place. Even late at 10.00 
p.m. the students were practising and they all scrambled around us to

11
talk about music education in India. They were astonished to hear of 
the predominance of Classical Indian Music over the modern, inspite 
the fact that India had the latest musical fads of the West.
On the morning of 11th June we visited the "Kolkhoz Communi sma" 
whose chairman Mr. Lubsanov gave a detailed account of its activities, 
took us round the secondary school, the dom kulturi or House of Culture, 
and introduced us to the political secretary Mr. Nikolayev Georgievich 
Kakorin who was a fine gentleman.We went to a wooden house where
lamps were lit to an altar of Burkhans.We had the pleasure of visit-
ing the house of a middle-aged lady who had a good number of rare 
Mongolian Buddhist texts. She knew the importance of every xylograph 
and discussed with us the merit of every edition. She showed us the 
Mongol translation of the Bodhi-cary avatara by Agwang Zhimba alias 
Vagindradana of the Tsugolsky Monastery. She kindly presented us a 
bilingual Tibetan-Mongolian edition of the Lam rim dmar khrid, and the 
Aginsky print of the biography of Ison kha pa.
In the afternoon we went to inspect the Pioneer Camp "Tuy a" 
(Dawn) belonging to Secondary School No.1 at Ulan-ude.It was situated
by the side of the Zaghata Lake and presented a fascinating setting 
(Zaghata means "much fish"). In he evening we had dinner with Prof. 
& Mrs. Baldanzhabov. The Professor showed us several xylographs and 
manuscripts, including the oldest version of the Čaran teüke of which 
he is preparing a critical edition. We saw the Mongol alphabet-book 
xylographed at Aginsky and the list of printing-houses of three monas- 
teries. There were the Tibetan-Mongolian dictionaries of Vagindraka- 
1pabhadra of the Aginsky Monastery and Rol pahi rdo rje's Mhas pahi 
hbyun gnas.. There were manuscripts of Sum pa mkhan po's Buddhist 
cosmology, laws of lamaseries, Bury at marriage customs, Mongol

- 12
grammars, and Mongol chronicles. It was a chance discovery that there 
was a Yeke Quriye (Urga) edition of the sumbum (collected works) of
Bu ston.Prof. Baldanzhabov had the chojung (complete with the Kanjur-
Tanjur Catalogue) of this edition.
On the 12th of June we visited the Bury at Branch of the Siberian 
Section of the Academy of Sciences. The Bury at Branch is guided by a 
Presidiun whose Chairman is Prof. Dr. u.V. Makey ev. The geologist Mr. 
S. A. Guruly ov is the Vice-Chairman. It is divided into four major 
institutes: Institute of Social Sciences, Institute of Natural Sciences, 
Institute of Biological Sciences and the Institute of Pedagogics. The
Institute of Social Sciences also works on the cultures, history, 
languages and literatures of the East. We were warmly welcomed at 
the Bury at Br ch by its Vice-Chairman Mr. S. A. Gurulyov. Among those 
present were Mr. Zandanov, Vice-Director of the Institute of Biolo- 
gical Sciences, the mathematician Mr. Alexander Vasilyevich Bulgaday ev 
the Vice-Director of the Institute of Social Sciences, the Sinologist 
Mr. E.V. Maltseva, the Tibetanist Mr. R.E. Pubayev Head of the Depart- 
ment of History and Culture of the East, Mr. Tsy bikov an expert on 
The researches of the the modern culture of Mongolia, and others. 
Bury at Branch are published from Ulan-ude, Novosibirsk, Leningrad and 
Moscow.While most of the publications are in Russian, some of them
arealso in Bury at and Mongolian languages. We were also taken round
the Institute of Biological Sciences by therector himself, Mr.
Bulgadayev. A new building of the Institute of Natural Sciences is
under construction.Surrounded by taiga forests, its calm and quiet
setting will be an ideal place for research.
In the afternoon we were taken to the Institute of Social 
Sciences, where Prof. R.E. Pubayev the Head of the Department of

13
istory and Culture of the East, received us in a most cordial manner. 
He is a specialist on the history of Buddhism. He is translating and 
annotating the Chronicle of Sum pa michan po. He that he 
was sorry 
s 
could not obtain my e ition of the final portion of Sum pa mkhan po's 
chojung. Welcoming us he said: "Our best greetings to you on our 
visit. It will be a step in strengthening the friendship between the 
peoples of the Soviet Union and India. We are still more pleased to 
receive such outstanding scholars like you from India. And we feel yet 
more happy fr since long we have known about the work of Prof. Raghu 
Vira, your father. We are glad to know what is being done at the 
International Academy of Indian Culture and to establish relations with 
your Academy." Mr. Zandanov the Vice-President of the Institute was 
also present. He is an economist, specialising in the "production power 
of our eonomics". Over-looking us was the portrait of the great 
Buddhologist the late Prof. G.N. Rumy antsev who worked with equal ease 
in the fields of Mongolian, Tibetan and Sanskrit. At the Institute 
several scholars are engaged on the history, language and culture of 
the Bury ats. According to Prof. Pubayev, the Institute is investiga- 
ting "five problems" in orientalistics:
(1) Archaeology: Before the consolidation of the Bury at people, their 
ancient tribes were in close connection with Central Asian tribes. 
These inter-tribal contacts are under study. Mr. Konovalov, an archae- 
ologist, is busy n the early nomad tribes of Bury atia. Mrs. Khamsena 
This is continuing resear es on the late nomad tribes of Bury atia. 
work on the history of Bury at tribes from the oldest upto the latest 
period was begun by Prof. Rumy antsev.
(ii) Mongolistics:A history of Mongolian culture up to our day is 
being compiled. Prof. Baldanzhabov is busy on it. Two parts on the

14
history of Mongolian culture from the 12th to the 17th centuries will 
come out in 1968. A project on the history of Inner Mongolia has 
been initiated this year. Mrs. Maltseva, an expert on moden Chinese 
literature, is in charge of it. Mr. Tsedenov is collecting data on

of the Peoples of Asia, Moscow in completing the Tibetan-Russian- 
English Dictionary (with Sanskrit equivalents) started by the late 
Prof. G.N. Roerich. They urgently need my Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary 
for the purpose. Mr. Badarayev has almost completed the Russian 
translation of the Tibetan gramm of Gser tog. He is also devi sing 
a sy stem of transcribing Tibetan into the Cyrillic script. We have 
already referred to the work of Mr. Pubayev.
(v) Historical Monuments: Among them will be published the rich notes 
of expeditions to the distant parts of the Bury at ASSR and adjacent 
still
regions. They will include folklore, which is being collected by teams 
of Bury at scholars. The most precious of them, however, are the 
manuscripts and xylographs in Tibetan and Mongolian. The Bury at coll- 
of

is estimated that there would be about 7000 xylographs, excluding the

providing funds andadditional staff. New scientists will be occupied 
mainly with the catalogue, under thedance of Mr. Semichov.
Two fascicules of the Opisanie Tibetskikh Rukopi sei i ksilografov by 
B. D. Dandaron appeared from Moscow in 1960 and 1965. The second 
fascicule comprises the sumbum of Sum pa mkhan po. Further work on 
the scientific catalogue of Bury at and Mongolian manuscripts and 
xylographs is continuing. After completing the cataloguing of 
Tibetica and Mongolica the Institute will be aware of "the treasures

16
we have" and it will take up the most important and unique works for 
publication. The Director expressed hope that they will be able to 
enlist he close cooperation of Indian scholars. He presented us 
several publications of the Institute and informed us that the 4th 
volume of the Trudi Buryatskovo Kompleksovo Naučno Issledobatel skovo 
Instituta, dedicated to Stcherbatsky, will appear within this year. 
The 5th volume, devoted to Vasilyev, is under preparation. We ere 
shown several representative manuscripts, including a Tibetan Prajñā- 
Paramita written in gold (gser yig). The 8 volumes of the sumbum 
(collected works) of Čaqar Lobsang Tshulthim are also preserved. A 
unicum at the Institute is a complete set of the Mongolian Kanjur written 
by hand in black and red inks. The alternation of black and red lines 
differs on various pages. One page had 5 lines of black, followed by 4 
lines of red, 6 black lines + 4 red lines + 5 black lines, giving a 
total of 24 vertical lines per page. This Kanjur was written in the 
second half of the 19th century.
In the evening we were taken to a 30 minute film on Buddhism in 
the USSR. It was shown at the Party Committee House, besides the 
colored music al comedy "Shepherd's Song." The national ballet "Angra 
Beauty," with the outstanding Bury at Ballerina Sakhi anova in the lead- 
ing role, was also screened.
On the 13th morning we paid a visit to the Republican Hospital 
with 20 clinical departments, more than 600 beds, and half a dozen of 
their own helicopters to rush medical help to distant villages in cases 
of emergency. At 11.00 a.m. our delegation was received by His Exce- 
llency Mr. Alexander Sergey evich Tsirinov, the ice-President of the 
Supreme Council of the Bury at ASSR and the Mayor of Ulan-ude. He gave 
us a most cordial welcome and related the astounding progress made by

17
post-Revolutionary Bury atia.The development of Ulan-ude is pheno-
menal in all modern aspects.One is wonderstruck that even remote
villages share the advantages of electricity, schooling, clothing, medi- 
care, housing, agriculture and other benefits of modernisation.
In the afternoon we paid a visit to the Ethnographic Museum 
where pre-Revotionary Bury at life is contrasted vividly against that 
after the Revolution. A complete yurt of a poor Bury at with its indi- 
genous utensils, dresses and household articles provides a sharp 
contrast to the yurt of a rich man gorgeously dressed, surrounded by 
the finest indigenous handicrafts, colorful furniture, and an altar 
with exquisite burkhans. An itemwise description of the two yurts can 
provide a eep into nomadic life. The Museum has a huge pot (perhaps 
an urn) belonging to the third century B.C. and other early objects 
which are of historic interest. Gigantic images of Ary av alokitesvara 
and Loan srin, and an enamelled image of Tson kha pa brought from Tibet 
are some of the attractions of the Museum. On the first floor, modern 
development is illustrated through hundreds of photographs, including 
those of X. Namsaraev the founder of Bury at literature and Tsedenj abov 
Gombozhab who became the first Peoples' Artist of the USSR on 1 Nov. 
1940. At Ulan-ude, there is also the Historical Museum which houses 
the famous andan jovo. We hope to visit it next time, as it is of 
the greatest import for our studies.
In the afternoon with a sad heart we bade goodby to Ulan-ude, 
and left for Chita, the Capital of the Chita Autonomous Region. The 
Aeroflot plan flew 5000 3000 meters high over the greenly clad moun- 
tains. The flying time from Ulan-ude to Chita is 55 minutes and the 
fare is 10 roubles. We reached Chita at 6.25 p.m. and had our meals 
at the airport restaurant. From Chita we left by cars to Aginsky.

18
Charming lakes, like Lake Kyenon, wooden houses of pre-revolutionary 
days, the majestically flowing River Ing ada, the bracing breeze of the 
taiga forests- made our drive to Aginsky the finest hours of the trip. 
At midnight we reached Aginsky, dead tired. We were received in national 
yle with yoghurt and honey in silver spoons from silver vessels. 
Aginsky is a legend for those who have taken interest in things Bury at, 
in her thought and her deep traditions. All the great Soviet and early 
Buddhologists enriched science by drawing upon the inexhaustible manus- 
cript resources and unparalleled scholarship of the lamas of this
monastery. Aginsky Datsan is the prime place in Russian Buddhological
literature. The Bandida Hambo Lama has lived here all his life, studied 
here for 16 long years, and it is only for the last four years that 
he has moved to the Ivolginsky Monastery.
At the Aginsky monastery there are two temples. One of them is 
the historic temple of 1816 and the second was built in 1846. The 
second temple is situated at a distance from the first, outside the 
fence of the present complex. Picturesquely surrounded by pines, it 
is preserved as a monument of architectural importance. Nowadays it 
is used as a city sanatorium. Though it was built in 1846, it looks 
older than the functioning temple of 1816 which has been repainted in 
recent years.
On the morning of 14th June a special service was held in honour 
of our Delegation. It was performed in the historic temple of 1816.
Its entrance door bore the official Tibetan name: Chos sde chen po 
bde chen 1hun grub glin. The 69 year old Deputy Hambo Lama Talsan 
himba Gonchikov presided over the ceremony. About twenty lamas took 
Part. There are nearly hirty lanas at Aginsky, but all could not be 
present. The Itegel, Sixteen rhats (nay dan), and the stotra to Tson

19
kha pa from the moriem were recited. The serenity, grace and dignity 
of the worship amidst the clanging assonance of a variety of instruments 
scatters its illumination into the turbulences of the psyche.
As we came out of the temple the upper part of the inner side
of the door was decorated with a lovely scroll of bskah rdzas. A 
large crowd of young and old, children and grownups had gathered out- 
side. Predominantly composed of Bury ats, it had a fair sprinkling of 
Russians some of whom have deep faith in Buddhism. We went around 
the temple in pradaksina or circumambulation with the temple to our 
right. There were a number of isolated shrinelets providing cover to 
single stone images of deities. One of them enshrined Simhanada Arya- 
valokitesvara under which the mantra of an hrth Shanada hun phat was 
inscribed in Tibetan, Buryat and Lantsha scripts. A little further 
lay a stupa to the former Bandida lambo Lana, Sharapov Yighidorje, 
built in 1963.Moving on, the Bandida Tambo Lama showed us a hundred
year old Majusria century is a venerable age. A shrinelot covered 
ayan übgen whose Sanskrit name was written down in my diary by an 
Aginsky lana as Bhumipati Tvarasiddha. A few paces onwards was Acala
Mahakala (Myo mgon po).
At the Aginsky Monastery also, the Bandida Haabo Lama has planted 
the Bodhi and Banyan trees. They have g. own in the warmth of a pyechica 
or Russian heater, from seeds which the Bandida Hambo Lama brought from 
India in 1956. The bany an tree is nay agorda in Bary at, from Sanskrit 
DZDZ rodha. The Patriarch loves both the trees like his children. 
Thereafter, we were led to the wooden yurt which is the residence of 
the Patriarch when he comes to his alma mater of Aginsky. To honour a 
guest in the yurt is a monument of our national culture." The Bandida 
Hambo Lama told us of real yurts in the country side where cattle-keepers

live. They have separate winter and summer yurts. He narrated how 
he had passed his life at Aginsky and how deeply he was attached to 
this monastery surrounded on all sides by green mountains, and a 
rivulet that flows by in languid innocence. On 15 March 1967 his 70th 
anniversary had been celebrated. Every now and then he would roll us
into laughter with anecdotes of his travels.
In the afternoon we visited the library of the Aginsky Monastery, 
situated on the second storey of the functioning temple. A steep and 
narrow wooden staircase led to the library. In the centre was the
architectonic mandala of Yamantaka.A huge wooden gand attracted our
attention. It was made of aguru and sandal woods and was used to
summon the people to the temple. All around, texts were stacked in 
colourful wooden shelves. The Aginsky Monastery has always been fous 
for its blockprints and they are prized treasures through-out the world 
of scholarship. To see hundreds of these priceless riches assembled 
at one place seemed unbelievable. In passing, we may mention that

learning.He loves the books dearly.
At 4.00 p.m. we saw the breath-taking storage-collections of 
thankas at Aginsky. A 5.00 we were given a farewell reception by the 
Deputy Hambo Lama who said: 
"We are very glad that you have visited 
this distant corner of the world. We are happy much more so, as you 
come from the country of the origin of Buddhism. On 7th December 1966
we observed the 150th anniversary of this Temple. May the friendship 
between India and the USSR always flourish. Cur most cherished wish 
is that there may always be peace all over the world. We wish that
you may come here again and again, any time you like. We wish you a 
happy journey and every success in your excellent doings. Bkra sis 
sog. " At 6.00 p.m. we left Aginsky, with heavy hearts and arms heavier 
still, laden with gifts of varied description.The main gate of the 
monastic complex bore the Lantsha inscription: "Om padnosni savmale hum 
." phatThe Zulur mountains flanked us on the left while Bandida Hamb 
Lama Zhambal dorje blessed our sad, tiresome return to Chita, en route 
to Irkutsk, Ulanbator, Leningrad and Moscow. We were fast flitting 
across this remote world of the Buryats, which had rippled before our 
gaze, to be lost again into looming horizons. The verdant mountains, 
the inviting taiga forests, the tranquil waters, and the fresh breeze -
a twin sister to the spring all had greeted us tenderly. The romance 
of the hard nomadic life has passed. Now it is replaced by life's deep, 
warm realities. Every where there were banners proclaiming slava or 
glory to mighty achievements of the Soviets. Let us add another slava 
to the great Soviet Union for preserving the historical monuments of 
the Bury at world of illumined thought and spiritual awareness.

TIBETAN BUDDHIST TEXTS PRINTED BY THE 
MDZOD-DGE-SGAR-GSAR MONASTERY
by
LOKESH CHANDRA
New Delhi
As pointed out earlier¹ the handlists of the lamaist monastic printeries 
(par-tho) are a valuable peep into the vast literature of the lamaist world 
written in Tibetan by the numerous tribes of the Himalayan and Trans- 
himalayan regions going up to the Siberian steppes and even to the 
banks of the Volga. The local printeries attain greater significance as 
we can glean from them the opuscules and magnum opus of the local 
savants besides the collected works of eminent scholars whose fame 
roamed over the vast expanses of Lamaism and the xylographic boards 
of whose opera omnia lent a special significance to even not very major 
monastic printeries which had the privilege of preserving them. For 
instance, our monastery had attained special renown by publishing2 
the complete works of A-khu-rin-po-che Ses-rab-rgya-mtsho(4), who 
has rendered a signal service to the history of lamaist literature by his 
outstanding tho-yig or list of rare works classified subjectwise. It has been 
edited in part 3 of the author's Materials for a History of Tibetan Lite-
rature.
The title of our par-tho on the cover-page is given as Dgaḥ-ldan-rab- 
rgyas-glin-gi dpar-tho bzhugs-so, while at the beginning of the text the 
significant appellative Mdzod-dge sgar-gsar is added to the aforesaid 
title which makes it possible to identify the location of the monastery 
with precision. In the Amdo region, down the Ang-khor Valley are the 
two famous Mdzod-dge lamaseries, the Old and the New, known as 
Mdzod-dge sgar-rñin (Chinese: Mo-wu chiu-ssu or the Old Mo-wu 
Monastery) and the Mdzod-dge sgar-gsar (Chinese: Mo-wu hsin-ssu or 
the New Mo-Wu Monastery).3 Our par-tho pertains to the New Mdzod- 
dge monastery which was to the East of its old counterpart.

TIBETAN BUDDHIST TEXTS
The par-tho is handwritten. It is divided into two parts. The first part 
consists of books of long format, but there is no specification to this 
effect. The second part pertains to xylographs of small format (sna- 
thun-gi skor). The extent of the texts is normally given in folios, and 
occasionally in volumes (pothis) or chapters. The long format contains 
works of a fairly long extent like the Aṣṭasahasrikā (with adnotations, 1),5 
commentary on the Mañjuśri-Namasangīti (14), the piṇḍārtha of Bodhi- 
sattvabhumi (13). Besides commentarial works there are historical 
writings like the biographies of Atīsa (2) and his disciple Ḥbrom-ston (3) 
well known as the Pha-chos and Bu-chos, two biographies of the Gun-than 
Bstan-pahi-sgron-ma (18, 19). In the Tantras, we meet with two scholia 
(5, 6) on the Guhyasamaja-tantra (Tohoku, 442) and Nam-mkhah-grags' 
exposé of utpatti- and sampanna-kramas in the Guhyasamaja. Among 
philosophical items are zin-bris of Gun-than (9) and Ri-khrod-dbań-po 
(10). Guruyoga texts, which form a very fundamental part of lamaist 
literature, are represented by a zin-bris of Dgah-ldan-lha-brgya-ma. 
This part closes with a few texts, of shorter extent, on bali-vidhi, prativi- 
dhāna, homa and eulogia (16, 17, 20, 21, 22: these might well have been 
engraved on small size xylographs). The biggest and most important 
item are the collected writings of Ses-rab-rgya-mtsho or Prajñāsāgara 
in eight volumes. The elucidation of the Vajravali and of the abhiseka 
of Mitrayogin by Hbo-ra Don-grub lends a local colour to the par-tho. 
The second part of the list contains xylographs of small format and 
as may be expected they contain works of daily recitation, ritualia and 
eulogia whose frequent or constant use demanded a handy size. Besides, 
their rather short extent also rendered the small format appropriate: 
most of them range between 1-23 small folios. We may draw attention 
to the fact that texts extending over 23 folios are only those canonical 
works which were used for daily recitation; like the Samcayagāthā (23), 
Guhyasamaja (26), Mañjuśrī-Nāmasangīti (28), and the Bhairavatantra
3 See J. F. Rock, The Amnye Ma-chhen Range and Adjacent Regions (Rome, 1956), 
p. 26, and Map 3 (+35°) in the flap at the end.
4 Four sizes of xylographs are distinguished:
(i)long format or "arrow-length" (mdaḥ-tshad-ma, par rin-po)
(ii)medium format (par ḥbrin)
(iii) short format (par thun)
(iv) very short format (śin-tu-sna-thun)

(29). The guruparampara (bla-brgyud) of the Guhyasamāja (24) and 
the special recitation to precede and to end this (?) Tantra, are followed 
by the first and last chapters of the Samvara-tantra (Tohoku 368) which 
are specially holy: ādi- and paryavasana-kalyāṇa. Two guruyoga texts 
are the Gurupañcāśikā (30) from the Canon and the Gurupūjā by a 
Panchen Lama. Later guruyoga texts are listed further on, under nos. 
44-49. Pranidhanas of the Lam-rim (35), Sukhāvatī (36, 37), Sarvavid 
(38); tea offering (39), short biographicals (41, 42), stotra (50), adhyeṣaṇā 
(51) and eulogia indicated by their opening words (52-57) are some of 
the types of minor texts in this part. Services to Mahākāla (61), Devi (62) 
Gñan (63), Dharmaraja and Lcam-sriń (65); bali to Vaiśravana (66) 
and Vajrasadhu (67), water-bali (69); glud for cattle (70) and an agri- 
cultural dhāraṇī (75) - all are from the day-to-day life of the people. 
Finally, after leaving about three inches of blank space the par-tho lists 
illustrations of mandalas and rakṣācakras which were to be had from 
the printery. The par-tho seems to follow a general pattern in listing 
the books according to their size and concluding with the illustrations 
we find this pattern throughout the catalogue of the printing blocks of 
31 Buddhist Transbaikalian monasteries from the archives of the N. E. 
Siberian Buddhist Patriarch the Pandita Mkhan-po, edited by Academi- 
cian Rinchen in Four Mongolian Historical Records,8 pp. 71-121.
After these few general remarks we proceed to reproduce the par-tho

may be due to a drstipluti in the original codex from which our
manuscript was copied. The possibility of a second drstipluti on 
the part of our scribe can also not be ruled out, because of the 
complexity of the transpositions and duplication.

LOKESH CHANDRA, NEW DELHI (INDIA)
VAIŠRAVANA/KUVERA IN THE SINO-JAPANESE TRADITION*
TRANSCRIPTIONS OF THE NAME
Bishamon=Skt. Vaiśravana, Vaiśramana, Pali Vessavana; Tib. rnam- 
thos-bu, rnam-thos-sras 'son of one who is fully-heard' (that is to say, of the 
glorious, Skt. Viśravas, name of the father of Kuvera). Other transcriptions are: 
(1) Beishirabana T 1298, Bisharabana Gog. 19, T 2129.6, which corresponds to 
Skt. Vaiśravana; (2) but most of the transcriptions correspond to Skt. Vaiśra- 
mana: Beishiramana T 1246, Beisharamana T 901.11, Heishiramana T 665.6, 
T 1246, Beishiramana T 2129.6, Bishiramanō Eog. 1, etc.
EXPLANATIONS OF THE NAME
Name of one of the four Lokapālas (Jap. Tennō). He presides over the 
north over yakṣas and over riches, war, etc. Most of the translations of his 
name rest on the Sanskrit name Vaiśravaṇa (root śru 'to listen'): the most com- 
mon form is Tamon 'well-heard' which is interpreted in different ways: many 
people speak of his richness Gog.19, T 2129.6, he oftenl istens to the preaching of 
the Dharma Eog. 1, T 1721.12. The same interpretations are attached to the 
translation Fumon 'vastly-listened,' Hemmon 'heard on all sides' Gog.19, T 2129.6. 
Gog.19 gives a translation Rimon 'separately heard' where the Skt. prefix vi 
(from which is derived Vai°) is taken in a separative sense. Eog. 1 gives a queer 
gloss on the form Vaiśramaņa: Vai is an exclamation preceding the word 
śramana 'monk'; in the origin this king was termed Kuvera (Kukotsura, correctly 
Kubira), but he arrived one day donning the robes of a monk to listen to the 
preaching of the Buddha; and when he entered the assembly of listeners (śrāvaka) 
they said to one another: 'Vai, śramaņa! vai, śramaņa! He! here is the monk, 
here is the monk!' hence his new name.
REGENT OF THE NORTH
As regent of the north Vaiśravana figures not only in the series of the 
Four Lokapalas but also in those of the Gods of the Eight Directions (Happōten), 
among the Twelve Gods (Jüniten), etc. He lives in the north of mount Sumeru 
on the northern flank of the mountain at mid-height, T 24.6, and 25.6, T 2121.1 
(on the summit of Yugandhara, at 42,000 leagues from the earth), T 1644.5
*Adapted from the Hōbōgirin, ed. Sylvain Lévi and J. Takakusu, Tokyo 1929, s.v. Bishamon,
1.79-83.

(between the two summits of Yugandhara), T 1558.11 (K. Lav. 3.160: on the 
fourth terrace, at the mid-height of Sumeru, at the level of the summit of 
Yugandhara, where there are the castles of the Sun and the Moon); or at 1000 
leagues to the north of Sumeru T 1.20, or at 4000 leagues T 23.3.

It has three cities, a park and a pool whose names differ in the texts:

hattei; third city, T 1.20 Shuki 'all the refuges' (or: 'refuge of assemblies'), 
T 23.3 Aniban, T 24.6, 25 Adabanta (and compare the following transcriptions 
designating one of the cities of Vaisravana: T 310.3 Atabattei, T 1245 Anaka- 
batei, 999 Anakabatei =Skt. Aṭakavati, Alakavatī; T 982.2, T 2128.11 Ana-

The name of the park is: T 1.20 Kabientō, T 23.3 Kabienta, T 24.6, 25.6 
Kabien. The name of the pool is: T 1.20 Narinni, T 23.3 Nari, T 24.6 
Natsuini, T 25.6 Nacini (Skt. Nalini, Naḍinī). Vaiśravana, who is the most 
important of the Four Kings, alone has a park and a pool (and the other three 
Kings only one city each); but his residence communicates by flight of steps with 
those of the other three, who come to visit him and to promenade in his park. 
T 1644.5 describes in detail his city as well as his kingdom.
It is he who protects the continent situated to the north of Sumeru, 
Uttaravati T 397.51, or moreover, to the south of Sumeru, the northern part of 
Jambudvipa T 397.52: that is in effect, adds the latter text, in Jambudvipa 
where appear the Buddhas, and that is why Vaisravana keeps vigil over the 
four kingdoms of Ogamagada, Bōgamagadha, Abanta and Shidai; he has received 
the mission of Buddha himself: with his 91 sons who traverse the ten directions, 
mounted on animals, men, women, and with the yakṣas, rakṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, 
pretas, pisacas, nāgas, devas, constellations who form his army. He defends 
Buddhism and reprimands the bad; to the pious he assures five advantages: 
increment of life, of riches, of health, of pleasure, of fame; but he abandons dis- 
ciples perverse to royal justice.
In T 2043.6 and T 2042.6 it is from Indra that Vaiśravana receives, after 
the passing away of Buddha, the mission to protect Buddhism in the region of 
the north, specially against the attacks of three cruel kings: Śaka, Yavana, 
Pahlava. And it is in the countries of the north that Hsuan-tsang encountered 
the cult of Vaisravana T 2087.1, 12: the great monastery of Balkh was protected 
by his image, which had miraculously warded the armed attack of a Turk

139
Khan; and the kings of Khotan claimed descent from Vaisravana, their first 
ancestor had been born in front of the statue (on this latter legend, cf. Kse.45). 
T 2126.2 asserts 'very close' connections that existed between Vaiśravana and 
Khotan, and claims that his name, Bishamon was taken from one of the names 
of the country of Khotan, Bishabu. Compare also T 982, 984, 985 (JA 1915, 
1.53), which assign as residence to Vaisravana the country of Tukhāra.
HEAD OF YAKSAS
He presides over yakṣas. Mahāmāyūrī (T 982, 984, 985) mentions him as a 
yakṣa, in two places, first under the name of Vaisravana, and then under that of 
Vaiśramaņa (JA 1915,1.53 and 58). T 279.67 he is the head of the multitude 
of yakṣas. T 1644.5 from Yugandhara upto northern Cakravāḍa, all the 
yakṣas depend on him. In T 1331.4 he pronounces this stanza: at another 
time cultivating awakening, I became the king of yakṣas for the benefit of 
beings, to those who dwell in the darkness of ignorance, I open their eyes with 
my hatchet of gold; and I save them from transmigrations, and elevate them to 
nirvana. In T 1245, a late text which is specially consecrated to him, he pro- 
nounces a sutra entitled Adanôtei (= Pali Aṭānāṭiyasutta of Digha-nikāya 32 
which does not figure in the Chinese translations of the Agamas; cf. also 
Hoernle, Manuscript Remains, 24 sq.), by the grace of which the disciples of 
Vaisravana can defend themselves against those yakṣas dependent on Vaiśravaṇa 
who are faithless and malevolent. In reality this sūtra treats of the Four Kings, 
and the fourth, who rules over the north, is designated here Yakṣa Kuvera; he 
has 91 sons named Taishaku (a name designating ordinarily Devendra Śakra= 
Indra), who are amenable to Vaiśravaṇa, and who by their example stimulate all 
the yakṣas to protect the north. In the same text T1245, Vaisravana pronounces 
dhāraṇīs destined to subjugate malevolent gandharvas, piśācas, kumbhāṇḍas, 
pretas, nagas, etc.
In T 999.1-2 (= Skt. Mahasahasrapramardini), Vaiśravaņa teaches a 
dhāraṇī to subjugate yakṣas who seduce men, bewilder them, dement them, 
devour them: it is me who am their king, he declares, and they adore the holy 
image placed inside the stupa which I hold in the hand. In the same text Buddha 
teaches the 'dharani of king Brahma' which enables one to subdue the eldest 
son of Kuvera, the grand yakṣa Samjaya who rides a man, and his other sons 
Janika, Daimi 'grand demon' and Ufuku Jar-belly'. According to T 1509.54 
and T 2129.6, at times he presides over yakṣas and over rākṣasas. T 1297: 
when Vaisravana is joyous the yakṣas do not hurt men; when he is angry they

140
disorders.T 1.20 (= T 2121.1) and T 24.6 (= 25.6): he is always 
cause 
accompanied by five yakṣas who guard his person: (1) T1 Hanjarō, T 24 
Gojô = Pañcāla; (2) T1 Dandara, T 24 Kōya 'Brushwood' (this translation 
corresponds to Skt. Aṭavaka, cf. Atabaku); (3) T 1 Keimabatsuda =: Skt. 
Haimavata, T 24 Konsen 'Mountain of gold' (Skt. hema 'gold'); (4) T1 
Daigera, T 24 Jōshin 'long-body'; (5) T 1 Shuitsuroma, T 24 Shimmō =Skt. 
Suciloma. Moreover, according to another list given by Bdjt. 1487: (1)
(2) Dokken, (3) Nata =Skt. Naḍa, (4) Skt. Kubatsura
Zenniki, 
Kubāra, (5) Kanro =Skt. Amṛta.
FAMILY
T 850.2 attributes to him eight brothers, a mother and a grandmother. 
According to Std. 1 his father is called Rabada or Bananda, and his mother 
or Sofu. His eight brothers are none else but the eight yakṣa 
Mitsujaru 
generals who surround him in the Garbhamandala. T 1796.5: Manibhadra, 
Pūrṇabhadra, Pāñcika, Śātagiri, Haimavata, Visakha, Āṭavaka, Pañcāla. The 
text adds that in ancient times the third Pañcika was named Sañjaya (for 
the restitution of these names in Sanskrit compare JA 1915:1). According 
As for his sons the 
to the afore-cited T 1245 his brothers are gandharvas. 
number and the names vary in the texts. The eldest is most often designated 
Nata =Skt. Naḍa (cf. Naḍakūbara, name of the son of Kubera in Hindu my- 
thology). It is he who had transmitted to the Chinese master Dōsen, a tooth of 
Buddha stolen from India by the rākṣasas (T 2061). It is recounted in the Zen 
sect that he broke the bones and tore the hair for reinstating them to his father 
and mother and then preached the Dharma unto them Gte. 2; but this legend is 
not attested in the canonical texts Stj. 6. According to Bdjt. 1297 Nada has 
three faces and eight arms; but a ritual which is consecrated to him (T 
1297) says that he holds a tooth in his left hand, a three-pointed lance in his 
right, is of blue black colour, blended with red and tramples on a yakṣiņī; and 
according to this ritual Nada is not the son of Vaisravana but his grandson, 
more precisely the third son of his second son (called Hanshika =Skt. Pañcika 
Hmjr 813); he is a terrible demon who protects the state and Buddhism putting 
down wicked, tearing away their eyes and their hearts, breaking their heads 
with his baton of diamond, etc.
GOD OF WEALTH
As we have seen in many of the passages cited before, Vaisravana is often 
identified with Kubera, the Hindu god of riches; under this title he presides 
over riches (cf. Kubira). In T 397.52 he is regularly designated under the double

141
name Kubera-Vaiśravana (Kubira-Bishamon); and while the Aśokāvadāna T 
2042.6 terms him Bishamon, the corresponding passage of Aśokasutra T 2043.6 
names him Kubira. His wealth is proverbial: the fortune of a gṛhapati of 
Rajagṛha is compared to his T703; T279.77 compares the Zennu (kalyāņamitra) 
to Vaisravana, the dharma to his treasures, the practices to his fortunes and once 
again in T 279.78 the spirit of awakening to Vaiśravana which suppresses the 
suffering of poverty. In T 190.12 he is termed the 'proprietor of the grand 
depository of treasures' daikozōshu; in T 201.2 (tr. Hüber 59), Indra and Vai- 
śravana are cited as generous rich persons. In a story of T 202.4 he appears 
to lay woman Upasena (or Mahasenā) at the moment when she recites the 
Dharmapada on the top of her house: she hears a voice in the air; it is 
Vaisravana who goes to Virūpākṣa, accompanied by his thousand yakṣas; he 
says to Upasena: if I give you celestial joys what will you do with them; I am 
going to give you a good boon………...
Ekottaragama (T 125.26) narrates the history of Keizu 'head of the cock', 
a brahmin who was very poor to offer food to the Buddha and his followers who 
were invited to Kapilavastu, having been expelled by the local cofraternity of 
Brahmins. He borrowed money from a notable of the city, and promised that 
he could be sold as a slave for paying the debt. The brahmins accepted his 
money, but refused to lift the pronounced expulsion. On the order of the 
Buddha, Indra and Vaiśravana went to his assistance. Vaiśravana sought in 
the Sandal Forest a grand cuisine where his 500 yakṣas prepared the meals for 
the Buddha. He sent to the brahmin a bar of gold which when flung to the 
ground was transformed into a hundred thousand ounces of gold. With this 
gold the brahmin purchased the food cooked by the yakṣas, and could offer a 
magnificent feast to the Buddha, to his monks and to all the arhats who were 
miraculously present.
In the Suvarnaprabhāsottamarājasūtra T 665.6 (this passage is lacking in 
the other recensions T 663 and 664; a very late special sutra T 1244 is based on 
this text), Vaisravana teaches the Cintāmaṇi-dhāraṇī, which when pronounced 
according to certain rites, makes appear before the faithful the son of Vaiśra- 
vana, Zennishi (T 1244 Shanisa). He asks the faithful: why have you invoked 
my father? The faithful replies: I want riches for offering to the Triratna. 
Vaisravana enjoins his son to assure to the faithful a daily endowment 
of hundred kārṣāpaņa (T 1244 'pieces of gold'). The faithful can offer them to 
the Triratna and alms to the poor. Then the Devaraja adds: if the faithful 
wishes to see me in person while he finishes the image of Buddha (T 1244:

142
Śakyamuni preaching the Dharma), with Kichijoten =Śrī to his left and my-
self to his right, and all kinds of assistants of both sexes.... While he performs 
certain rites before this image, pronounces a long dhāraṇī......, then I appear 
before him in the form of a young person or of an old mendicant monk (T 1244 
of a lay person) holding a cintamani (T 1244 in my right hand) and a bag of 
gold (T 1244 a box of gold in my left hand) and grant all his wishes, and make 
him rich......
GOD OF WAR
And finally, Vaisravana was venerated in China and Japan as a god of war. 
T 1248 gives a dhāraṇī entitled 'Dhāraṇī of Devaraja of the north, Vaisramaṇa, 
who watches over armies for protecting the Dharma': if one pronounces this 
dhāraṇī before an image of Vaiśravana-which represents the Devaraja under 
his terrible aspect, dressed in armour plate, holding a lance in his left and his right 
resting on his hip, a stūpa which he offers to Buddha Śakyamuni, and treading 
on two black yakṣinis-he sends his third son Nada to the side of those who 
direct their troops for the protection of their country; or still, if one covers the 
armour plate of his image with the powder of gold and offers him perfumes, 
flowers and other offerings while pronouncing the dharani a hundred thousand 
times, he himself takes the command of his celestial troops and goes to 
support his devotee, to whom he assures victory; or furthermore, if one recites 
nonstop day and night he delegates his heir-prince Dokken at the head of cele- 
stial troops; or still one can suspend his image on a staff and carry it as a banner 
fifteen paces in front of the army which will render the enemy ineffectual.
A ritual of the same title T 1247 very specifically consecrated to Naḍa, 
adds in the colophon that during the 'grand troubles of the Five Kingdoms', 
one tried in vain during eight months all sorts of other ceremonies; only the rite 
prescribed in this text proved efficacious for stabilising the country. It refers to 
the troubles which burst forth in Central Asia in the end of the reign of Hsuan- 
tsang during the Tang dynasty and by the "Five Kingdoms" are intended the 
five foreign people who besieged the city of Anhsi. The incident is reported in 
details in the 'Ritual of Vaisravana' T 1249 (= T 2126.2 whose text is more 
correct): in the first year of T'ien-pao 742 A.D., the five kingdoms of Seiban= 
Tibet, Daiseki Arabs, Kōko-Sogdians, and others besieged the city of Anhsi. 
On the second day of the second moon, a report was presented to the Emperor 
demanding relief troops. The Emperor said to master I-hsing: Professor, the 
city of Anhsi is besieged by Arabs and others and it requires troops. But as it is 
situated at a distance of 12000 leagues, it will take eight months for my troops

143
to arrive there, and I do not know what to do. -I-hsing replied: Why does 
Your Majesty not invoke to your aid the Devaraja of the north, Vaiśravaṇa, 
with his celestial troops? -How can I invoke him? - By the intervention of 
the Serindian monk Daikōchi (T 2126 and Std.1 Amoghavajra). -The 
Emperor sent word to this monk who invited him to provide an incense-burner 
and follow him to the monastery. The monk pronounced a dhāraṇī (taken 
from T 246, adds T 2126) twenty-seven times. The Emperor then saw hundreds 
of soldiers in arms and the monk explained to him that they were the troops of 
Dokken the second son of Vaisravaṇa, who had come to take charge before de- 
parture for Anhsi. In the fourth month he received a report from Anhsi, declaring 
that, on the very day of the ceremony they saw appearing in the north-east of 
the city, the envelopings of an obscure haze, of giants dressed in armour plates 
of gold; they heard an uproar of drums and of horns, and experienced a violent 
trembling of the earth. The troops of the five kingdoms, frightened, retired to 
their camps, where rats of gold gnawed the strings of their bows and of their 
traps. A voice in the sky enjoined to spare the old and the feeble, who could 
not flee away. Then Vaiśravana manifested himself in person on the northern 
gate of the city. They drew his image which was appended to the report 
addressed to the Emperor. In consequence of these events, continues T 2126.2, 
an imperial edict directed all its provincial functionaries to place in the north- 
west angles of cities, images of Vaisravana and of his assistants, and all the 
Buddhist monasteries to consecrate a special edifice to him. Since then, this text 
which dates to the tenth century adds, it has been a usage in the prefectures to 
make offerings to Vaisravana on the first of every lunar month, while executing 
chants and dances: this is what is termed rakutenno 'rejoicing of the Devaraja'.
T 1249 citing the words of the same monk Daikōchi (Amoghavajra), gives 
a monthly programme of deeds and exploits of Vaisravana: on the first day of 
every lunar month he makes a reunion with the gods and demons; on the 
second day he takes leave of his second son Dokken who departs on a tour of 
inspection; on the 15th day, he makes a reunion with three other devarajas; 
on the 12th day he exchanges a stupa with his son Nada: on this day one 
should offer glutinous rice with milk or with honey.
In mediaeval Japan, Vaisravana was the patron (Mamori honzon) of 
warriors who received now and then in their infancy the surname of Tamom- 
as was the case of a celebrated hero of the 14th century, Kusunoki 
maru, 
Masashige.
In Mantrayana, his bīja is VAI, his symbolic form the baton or the stupa,

144
numerous are his dharaṇīs: the most usual is simply his name preceded by 
Namo. His principal mudra is as follows: the ring fingers are raised one against 
the other, the index fingers are bent like hooks, the other fingers are intersecting 
inside the palm T 1244; but there are several other mudrās.
ICONOGRAPHY
Vaisravana is figured in Japan like an armoured warrior; his attributes 
are generally a baton (daṇḍa) and a stūpa. This type confirms to the following 
texts: T 1244 on the palm of his left hand he holds a stupa which he beholds, 
and in his right hand a baton. T 1293 (colour blue black, dress red, hair violet). 
T 1298 adds that his body is golden, he is armoured, standing on two demons 
and flanked by two goddesses offering him flowers (fig. Kakuzenshō 6.2244). 
T. 908 omits the goddesses (Asabashō 6.2026). It is this latter type which is 
reproduced in the mandalas of Garbhadhātu (north portal of the exterior vajra- 
vali) and of the Vajradhātu (where Vaiśravana presides over yakṣas in the 
west); his seat is always a lotus instead of the two demons and the armour differs 
in the two mandalas (Bzss. fig. 327-328).
Often the baton is replaced by a long lance, generally with triple points 
and a pennant: T 1248 he holds in his left hand a lance, his right is placed on 
his hip; he treads on two black yakṣiņis and offers a stupa to Buddha Śākya- 
muni. T 901.11 his left hand holds a lance, his right a stupa (fig. Kaku- 
zenshō 6.2242; it is under this aspect that he is generally figured in the popular 
series of the seven divinities of good luck, Shichifukujin; compare also the statue 
preserved at Hōryūji, where he treads a unique demon). T 1246 he holds in 
his left a lance with three points; his right is on his hip (fig. Asabashō 6.2026; 
this type is preserved at Kuramadera near Kyoto, a temple consecrated to 
Vaisravana; cf. Renondeau, BEFEO 26.259 sq.). This text and T 1251.1 men- 
tion a type holding a stupa in the left and treading on three yakṣas of which the 
central is either Goddess of the Earth (Prithvi, Jiten), or Vināyaka (Binayaka), 
the other two are identified as Biramba and Niramba. Compare T 1203: he is 
mounted on a demon, holds a stupa in the right and rests the left on the 
hip.
Other attributes: T 1067 stūpa in the left, sword in the right, armour, 
young face, coiffure of jewels, angry aspect. T 1068 stupa in the left, vajra 
[club] in the right, colour violet. T 951.1 lance in the left, vajra in the right. 
Kakuzenshō 6.2241 (fig. 2243) lotus in the left, triple-pointed lance in the right, 
golden body, armour, sabre; a red bird in the coiffure. T 926 his body is 
green
and he holds a fork.

145
In the Lamaist tradition, Vaisravana holds a banner in his right hand and 
in his left a rat spitting jewels (Grünwedel, Myth. 181).
In China, modern usage attributes to him a banner and a stūpa, perhaps a 
compromise between the Chinese classical tradition attested by the texts cited 
above and preserved in Japan (cf. also BEFEO 25.440 sq.) and the lamaist 
tradition.
Aberrant types. In the Taimitsu sect (esoteric branch of Tendai) the rite 
called Humkhaḍaya (cf. T 2151) is celebrated in honour of a 'Double-bodied 
Vaisravana' (Sōshin Bishamon) who is a combination of Vaiśravana and the 
goddess Kichijōten/Śrī, Asabashō 6; the two personages are represented back to 
back, with red faces and three eyes, black dress, armour; one holds a vajra, the 
other a cakra (fig. Asabashō 6.2046). This iconographic type known in Japan 
since 1264 (Asabashō 6.2047) seems to be connected with the text of T 665.6 
where Vaisravana is associated with Śrī; moreover, Vaisravana and Śrī figure 
frequently side by side in the esoteric texts, for example, T 1249, T 850 etc. 
Later, the two personages were considered as the metamorphoses of Vairocana, 
on the one hand in the Garbhadhātu and on the other in the Vajradhātu, their 
combination symbolising the identity of the two dhātus (Hmjr. 892).
Tobatsu-Bishamon is a form of Vaisravana who appeared to the king of a 
country of Tobatsu or Topara, Asabashō 6.2028-2029; he is represented either 
under the normal aspect of Vaisravana, holding a stupa in his left hand, 
standing on the Goddess of the Earth who sustains his feet and is flanked by 
two demons (statue of Tōji of Kyoto, Bdjt. pl. 97; cf. above the text of T 1246); 
or astride a lion, and with four heads and ten hands of which eight hold sabres 
(tōhachi for tobatsu; fig. Bdji. 3517).
Another form with ten hands is mentioned in Asabashō 6.2054-5, which 
goes back to the 11th century: the skin is red, the dress black; two of the ten 
hands are joined, the others hold, to the left: (1)stūpa (2) bell (3) cakra 
(4) arrow and the string, to the right: (1) sickle (2) sabre (3) bow
(4) vajra.

THE 108 FORMS OF LOKESVARA IN HYMNS AND SCULPTURES
ी कान लकवगाथ नम : 97 
57 Srstikanta Lokeśvara
Prof. Dr. Lokesh Chandra 
J-22 Hauz Khas Enclave 
New Delhi 110016 (India)
April 1981

This preliminary note is intended to draw attention to the
urgency of a full-scale study of the texts, paintings/miniatures 
and sculptures bearing on the ever evolving forms of Lokesvara 
Avalokitesvara. From an attendant acolyte of Amitabha in the 
Sukhavati-vyuha, Avalokitesvara gained independence as a separate 
deity in his own right while the worship of his prototype Brahma 
ceased, until the great Adi-Sahkaracārya resurrected Brahma (masc.) 
as the abstract Brahma (neut.). The Potala Lokeśvara holds the 
mysteries of Harihara, the Devaraja cult and a key to the enigmatic 
faces at Angkor. Entire systems of thought lie embedded in the 
silent enigmas of Avalokitesvara.
The Macchandar Vahal series of 108 Lokesvaras (de alt herein) 
endows the orb of words of the text with the life of form. The 
whole being of a hymn stringing 108 epithets is incarnated into 
statues to become things of this earth, to celebrate the cosmos in 
the surety of living, to carry the eternal depth to the eyes of 
the faithful of the earth: beauté (fem.) or beauty sculpted in the 
round, to give birth to a state of open symbolism. These 
psychotrophic images open imagined worlds of well-being, happiness 
and bliss so that the human possesses all becomings. Common men 
exalt their being in the vision of these images sublimed by words 
of the hymn. Folk literature and plastic arts draw their vitality 
in the imaginings and images, reveries and substances of the 
flowering of transcendant experience and creativity. 
Lokesh Chandra.

The illustrations and descriptions of 108 forms of
Avalokitesvara were published for the first time by Benoytosh 
Bhattacharyya (1958: 394-431) from their statues in the Macchandar 
Vahal at Kathmandu the capital of Nepal. The drawings are 
strikingly crude. To check their original statues I visited 
Kathmandu in 1959, but they were no longer in the monastery. 
They had been replaced by pictures painted by the renowned 
Nepalese artist Mr. Siddhimuni Sakya. These pictures have been 
reproduced by Mr. Min Bahadur Shakya, the Chairman of the 
Publication Sub-Committee of the Young Men's Buddhist Association. 
They are line copies by Mr. Tantrikmuni Bajracharya, Mr. Ang Gelbu 
Sherpa and Mr. Gawang Tashi Sherpa under the supervision of late 
Amoghavajra Bajracharya. Each sketch is captioned below in 
Newari script. Comparison of the two sets yields surprising 
results.
1. The sequence of the numeration of Benoytosh Bhattacharyya 
(B) is the opposite of Shakya (S). Fig. 108 in B is Trya 
Avalokitesvara, while it the first form in S. The first form 
in B is Hayagriva Loke svara while it is the last (no. 108) in S. 
The sequence of S is more logical: it rightly begins with the 
primal form of Arya-Avalokitesvara. There are several aberrations 
in the reverse sequence of the two, for example: B 106 Maha- 
sthamaprapta Lokesvara is S 65. The precise sequence of the 
Lokesvara's can be determined by the text on which this series 
is based.

Chinese version
There is a Chinese translation of the Avalokitesvara-nām- 
astasataka, done by T'ien Hsi-tsai in A.D. 985 (Ta-Chung-lu 4 p. 
17a:18b)¹, under the title: Shêng kuan-tzu-tsai p'u-sa i-pai-pa 
ming ching (Jap. Shō kan-ji-zai bo-satsu ip-pyaku-hachi myō kyō). 
T'ien Hsi-tsai came from Kashmir (var. Jalandhara) to China along- 
with Danapala in A. D. 980. In this work, the 108 Sanskrit names, 
or more appropriately epithets, of Avalokitesvara are transliterated 
into Chinese characters and are numbered from 1 to 108. These 
serial numbers make it easier to restore the 108 Sanskrit names. 
In 1758 Lcan-skya Rol-paḥi-rdo-rje re-transcribed them into his 
system of Chinese transliteration in the quadrilingual collection 
of dharanis entitled: Yu chih man han meng-ku hsi fan ho pi ta
tsang ch'üan chou2. 
The Manchu, Mongol and Tibetan transliterations
were added.Rol-paḥi-rdo-rje made an effort to restore the 108
Sanskrit names (STP.11.3462-3475).
Tibetan version
The Avalokitesvarasya nam-aṣṭasatakam was translated into 
Tibetan, under the title Hphags-pa spyan-ras-gzigs-dban-phyug-gi 
mtshan brgya-rtsa-brgyad-pa (Toh. 705-900, 0t. 381-525). Translator's

Palace at Peking (STP), parts 1-22.

It is found in the Tibetan Kanjur in the tantra
section, as well as in the volume of dharanis:

=4214a-216a (Ot.525)
The Chinese and Tibetan translate the same Sanskrit text. 
The Tibetan version translates all the Sanskrit names, unlike 
the Chinese which transliterates them. They represent a different 
set of 108 names of Avalokitesvara and thus are of not any immediate 
use for the Macchandar Vahal series. They show an earlier tradttion. 
The first eight names are cited below from the Taishō edition of 
the Chinese Tripitaka as well as from the quadrilingual trans- 
literation of Rol-pahi-rdo-rje, as specimens of the epithets. 
The Tibetan division of the names differs from the Chinese. We 
have followed the numbers of the Chinese transliteration. The 
Chinese text is given in Japanese pronunciation, as read out by 
Prof. Zuiryu Nakamura of the Rissho University, Tokyo. The 
Chinese text has also been written out by Professor Nakamura. 
It is followed by the reconstituted Sanskrit equivalents. The 
next line transcribes the Tibetan text from the Narthang Kanjur.

Sanskrit manuscripts
A Sanskrit text called "Avalokitesvarasya astottara-sata-nāma 
mahāyana-sutra" is mentioned by Matsunami as part of a manuscript 
comprising a collection of dharanis and he refers to another 
manuscript in the Darbar Library. Its relationship to the Chinese 
and Tibetan versions requires investigation.
Raghu Vira Manuscript
There is a Sanskrit manuscript from Nepal in the Prof. Raghu Vira 
Collection at the International Academy of Indian Culture (referred 
to as M). Its first folio is lost (alas! a casualty to the beauty 
of its lovely! illustration). Its second folio begins with the
6th name: Sankhanatha (S 8, B 101). Names 6-108 are given in 
Out of these 102, 62 names are common to the appendix II. 
Macchandar Vahal series. The remaining 41 names are different:

Certain names of the Macchandar Vahal series which are not 
found in the Raghu Vira ms., seem to be later accretions from the 
Vajradhātu mandala of the yoga tantras. Vajradharma (Esot.422), 
Vajrasphota (Esot.441), Pratibhanakuṭa (Esot.506), Sarvasoka-tamo- 
nirghata-mati (Esot.512), Amitaprabha (Esot.517), Jalini prabha 
(Esot.519), and Candraprabha (Esot.520), occur in the Vajradhātu 
mandala in close proximity. Another interesting fact is that 
the 17 names beginning with maha are not to be found in the 
RaghuVira ms. except Mahāvajrasattva (M24), while three of these 
names Abhayankara (M53), Candravarna (M64 for Mahacan drabimba), 
Suryavarna (M65 for Mahasuryabimba) are without the prefix mahā. 
The prefix mahā indicates that the Macchandar Vahal series depict 
a more developed version of the stotra of 108 names of Lokesvara.
